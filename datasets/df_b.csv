hfb9u5,Honestly...how do you see this election going?,"Thinking realistically about how we think the country is going to vote.

Ignoring what any and all media tells us, it’s hard to say if Trump’s support has gone up or down since he won.

Also, Biden is MUCH less hated than Hillary was. Hillary was HATED, and if not for the email scandal...I think she would’ve won.

But we also have to consider what is happening in the country right now. The riots, the crime, Chaz, all that stuff. Will that push moderates or center people over to the right? In my mind, no rational, sane human being will see that and go “yeah...I want more of that. I’m gonna vote for more rioting, looting and cities being burned down”.  And historically, any time there has been rioting or anarchy, there has typically been a push back from the other side when it came to the next election. But hey, maybe I’m wrong, maybe the rioting has more supporters than I think.

What do you think? What do you honestly see happening?",1593038852.0,15,Republican

hdzs3e,What was the moment that solidified your support for Conservative values?,"For me it was about 2-4 yrs. ago. Trump had won the election about a month before this incident. I was taking a coding class at a Christian school at the time. I loved my teacher and still do, but she had some very liberal views despite being employed at a Baptist school in a blood red district in OH.

She talked to the class one day about future job opportunities for the STEM field. She was all about ""muh diversity"", and specifically wanted to favor women and minorities over white men in STEM job recruitment.

Her views confused me to say the least. Why should minorities get special recruiting offers in STEM or any other field? Why should I be put on the back burner over my sex and race? That doesn't seem fair at all.

That was the seed that eventually sprouted into me becoming a full-on ultraconservative.I started doing more research and found out that I was very Conservative, and agreed with the Republican party on 90% of issues. Eventually I morphed into a populist economically while keeping my ultraconservative social views. I'll be voting for Trump in 2020.

TL:DR I got redpilled by my Liberal teacher over diversity requirements in STEM fields.",1592856578.0,42,Republican

I’ll stop here because it only gets worse.

I understand that there probably were a lot of people who tuned in to the rally just to hate on Trump, but these numbers still speak for themselves. Maybe the silent majority is a real thing. I’d be more interested to see what the tv ratings were for the rally, but can’t seem to find any information on it at this time.

hd9lmx,"I'm a British black teenager, and not a single statue should be taken down","The reason behind why BLM chooses to take down and deface so many statues is a deep hatred for racism. It is so deep, however, that it has clouded their judgement to the point where they refuse to look back on history through a historical lens, and have instead chosen a black and white filter, separating every historical figure into people of pure evil or pure good, with nothing in between.

If only it was so easy to classify people. The truth is, nobody can be so easily judged like this, especially people who lived over 100 years ago in in a world which had very different moral beliefs from today.

Mohandas Gandhi was an open racist towards black people. Nelson Mandela was the leader of a group that bombed random innocent civilians. Mandela has a statue dedicated to him in the same place as the statue of Winston Churchill that was defaced, and yet, his statue remained untouched by BLM.

This isn't me saying that these people's statues should be removed as well. But those BLM supporters defaced the statue of a man who led the free world against the largest threat it has ever faced, based solely on the errors of his views on race. 

Why are we judging historical figures like this? Have we forgotten the fact that nobody in this world ever has been, or ever will be perfect? If we only allowed statues of perfect people, there wouldn't be a single one left standing. If BLM wants every statue of people who had errors in their character removed, they'd better remove the statues of Mandela and Gandhi as well.

When we look back on historical figures, we should balance how they are viewed based on what they did wrong AND what they did right FOR THE TIME THAT THEY LIVED IN. 

Churchill, Mandela, Washington, Gandhi, Jefferson. All these people did more right than wrong for their times, and all of the statues put up in their honor should remain there.

When I go to school and enter a history lesson, one of the key skills we learn there is how to evaluate history. Every person in this country has learned this since they were my age.

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

hctb6a,Any other independents leaning right this election? What issues am I not considering?,"I’ve voted both ways, but I’m having a hard time finding common ground on the Democratic platform this election.

I voted for Obama, twice. I believe in gay marriage and equal rights. I also believe in and hope that one day we will have healthcare for all, especially with as crazy as insurance premiums are. But Medicare has its flaws and I think we need more time to make something like this work in the US. It will be a bigger overhaul than I think we ever realized.

I’m a labor and delivery nurse, so I don’t have a view on abortion. I don’t believe in it, but I don’t believe in outlawing it either after my experiences at work, so I can’t vote solely on this as an issue.
I’m not sure Coronavirus should be an issue, I think it’s something we should be working on together, but it seems it is. I think people should be allowed to choose for themselves what to do and maybe we should set up food deliveries for elderly and those confirmed to have pre-existing conditions so they don’t have to leave home.

I believe in gun rights, and am a gun owner myself. I believe in the police, and in increasing funding to attract better candidates and provide the equipment, training, and anything they need. After becoming a foster mom, we had a little girl who’s mom was brought here from Guatemala as a teenager and sold to a man. The baby we had was born of rape and mom was violently attacked. Her story and all she went through made me certain we need better protection at the border.

I don’t like everything Trump says or does, but I think a lot of that is that he’s not a career politician. I do appreciate his transparency though. We’ve never not known how he feels good or bad. 

I do like Joe Biden as a person. I think he would be a great grandfather, but I worry about how confused he gets and I feel like he would be manipulated by career politicians. I don’t think he stands well on his own.

In the primary last year, I voted for Ben Carson. I still have a lot of respect for him. I voted for not Hillary, which was also a vote for Trump, but not because I particularly liked him.

I have watched so many people using the words ""Trump supporter"" to offend someone or call them a racist, a homophobe, and so on. Every time, I have to shut up, knowing damn well that I will just be canceled if I speak up. Since I work on campus, I am likely to be fired from my job as well if I make any comments that aren't far-leftist comments.

Even being silent might not be an option. One good example is the argument about cops: I believe not all of them are bad, but most students in my college believe all of them are bad ""because of the system"" or whatever. If people bring it up in conversation, I have to act like I am a left wing Democrat. If I take a neutral stance and say I don't care, I get into trouble. If I bring up my views, I am called a racist.

I work a job on campus which requires me to offer resources to different types of students, for their different needs. One popular resource I was asked to share is the video which raises bail funds for rioters. I do not endorse that. Arsonists and thieves should never have a get out of jail free card.

On the other hand, I have not been asked to share anything to students who might be related to police officers, or small business owners whose livelihoods are destroyed. They have mentioned police brutality in our diversity training, but they didn't mention black on black crime. And fun fact, black on black crime affects black people! Someone from the outside wouldn't be wrong to think that my job is more anti-police than pro-black.

I see a lot of stories on social media making fun of, and praising violence against, people who wear Trump clothing. A lot of people support the looting and rioting, spread awareness to ""vote to end racism"", want full abolition of police. This has increased following the police reform bills shared by Trump and the Senate. Part of the mob actually wanted police reform, but as soon as Trump agreed with them, they went back to the ""orange man bad"" narrative and called for abolition.

A lot of my fellow students support the Rayshard Brooks decision of felony murder, which says a lot. Other big California related news includes UCLA petitioning to fire a professor for NOT being racially biased, and the UCs voting to REPEAL the law that prohibits racial discrimination on college applications.

I do not reply to any of this because I do not want to lose my job, and I do not want to have a record that prevents future unemployment. I do not want to lose my friends, who I believe will be more open to disagreeing once everything is done. I'm not the privileged straight man the left makes me out to be. I have struggles too and I don't want to make them worse.

On that note, I'm not here for sympathy. I am here to share my thoughts and talk about some current issues with a like minded audience. I am hoping to find some fellow red students in blue states, and just have some good discussions.",1592649060.0,32,Republican

hcrwrd,Potential 2024 presidential ticket?,"I was thinking about what the perfect presidential ticket would be for Republicans based on current projected front runners. 

Imagine a Nikki Haley/Ivanka Trump ticket. Haley has proven herself to be a very strong conservative, while Ivanka has a more moderate political compass and will attract current DJT supporters. Ivanka is much less flamboyant and controversial as compared to her father as well. Add to the fact that they would potentially be the first female president and VP. They would bring in a much larger female vote than the normal republican ticket.

Overall I think that would be a very tough matchup for any democrat ticket to beat. A couple other people I think would be good candidates for president/VP are Pence and Desantis as well.

Hoping someone can provide clarity on my question. 

Back in 2016 a few of my friends publicly said that Trump would win the election (T-R-U-M-P we’re gonna trump Hillary was our slogan)
We were called every name in the book &amp; labeled as complete idiots who didn’t understand politics. But what we saw in America were a large group of voters being called names, told they were deplorable, told they didn’t understand politics &amp; were deemed sexist unless they voted for the girl. 

Fast forward to 2020 &amp; the left/Democrats are still using the same tactics of name calling &amp; criticizing that they used in the last election cycle. 

My question is: why do they think this tactic actually works? Do they simply not learn from their mistakes or are they literally too deranged that they believe this is the only logical way to act towards another group?

havbid,Black Lives Matter only very recently started using ActBlue to handle it's donations. $4.35 million in donations is at risk of being directed to ActBlue instead of to helping actual black communities. LONG READ,"This is the Black Lives Matter Website: [https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)

As I am sure everyone here is aware, when you click the ""DONATE"" button on the website it takes you to ActBlue. ActBlue is a service that uses it's donations to support left-wing political campaigns.

If you access the WaybackMachine you can view the website and find when the site started using ActBlue.

At some point between June 2019 and September 2019, the site stopped using a donations service called **ThousandCurrents**, and started using **ActBlue**: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/) *^((Maybe someone else can pinpoint the date a bit better than me)**)*

(Notice also that in June 2019 the ""DONATE"" button is black and yellow, like the rest of the site. In September 2019 the button is blue and white.)

Recently there has been some controversy over the fact that sites, such as GoFundMe, have been sending Black Lives Matter donations to ""The Black Lives Matter Foundation"". The Black Lives Matter **Foundation** is **NOT** affiliated with the Black Lives Matter **Website**. [https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not)

There has also been controversy over the recent AMA done on Reddit by the Black Lives Matter founder. (Note: the person who did that AMA is **NOT** the founder of the Black Lives Matter **Foundation**)

The Black Lives Matter Foundation uses donations to fund community events that foster bettter relations between black communities and the police - A noble and good cause. The Foundation is in no way affiliated with either the aforementioned website, founder or with the current riots/protests.

**$4.35 million** is at risk here. The money has been donated through websites, such as GoFundMe, to The Black Lives Matter Foundation and risks being redirected to ActBlue.

Today, when I woke up I saw that the story had hit the news, and surprise surprise now apparently it’s all the fault of the guy who was attacked, with them claiming he was apparently part of an “armed militia”. I also took time to watch the video that was linked by the articles (NBC and CNN) and to my surprise (note sarcasm) the videos were of much lower quality, taken at a horrible angle, and edited to appear that the shooting in self defense was unwarranted. At this point, why am I even surprised. Already the city mayor is on track to remove all the statues featuring anything about exploration, colonization, etc... and is now going to send social workers to violent incidents and not police.

What has Donald Trump done for the black community?

HBCU’s

The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act or commonly known as the “FUTURE” act was signed into law in December of 2019 by Donald Trump. The bill includes roughly $250 million dollars a year of permanent funding for HBCU’s. [HBCU’s](https://aaregistry.org/story/hbcus-in-america-a-short-history/) were founded to give former slaves higher education after the civil war. Slaves were not allowed to read, write, or learn at the level of others during slavery. Upon freedom after the Civil War they were immediately at an almost insurmountable disadvantage with the rest of American society. Without HBCU’s who knows where the African American community would be today. Without them we may never have had Martin Luther King Jr. or many other historically great African Americans. With this HBCU’s are not just building blocks of the past, but are also essential pieces to the [future](https://uncf.org/the-latest/6-reasons-hbcus-are-more-important-than-ever). More than 300,000 students attend HBCU’s yearly with 80% of them being African American. HBCU’s also graduate 20% of African Americans while making up only 3% of America’s colleges. This funding helps HBCU’s help the African American community. HBCU’s tend to have lower tuition, which allows low income minority families the opportunity to give their kids a higher education. A higher education that leads to better jobs and more economical advances for generations to come.

Tax Act

In 2017, Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. One major piece of this act was the opportunity zones and the corresponding investment in these zones. Opportunity [zones](https://eig.org/opportunityzones) are defined as an area that has a poverty rate of at least 20%. Unfortunately the poverty [rate](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) in the African American communities is currently at 22%, which is almost double the country average of 13%. The bill encourages major corporations to invest into poverty struck areas with capital gains. Capital gains are the profits made from a sale of property or an investment. Major corporations have billions of potential capital gains called unrealized gains. These unrealized gains are due to fluctuations and increases in stock prices. Every $1 increase in the stock price multiplied by shares outstanding are the unrealized gains the company has. Facebook for example has 2.49 billion shares outstanding. Meaning it has roughly 2.5 billion shares that can be traded publicly. In less than 3 months spanning from March 16, 2020 to June 8, 2020 Facebook stock has gained over $80. That is an increase of approximately $200 billion dollars in unrealized gains. To become realized gains, they would have to sell those shares and in return they would be capital gains which would be taxed. These gains are only taxed when sold and are taxed less the longer you hold them. This would encourage a company to hold onto the unrealized gains if possible. The act signed by Donald Trump gives tax breaks to these companies in return for them investing these realized gains into opportunity zones. This has exponential potential and no ceiling of [growth](https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-investors-opportunity-zones/) for these communities.

First Step Act

In 1994, the Federal Crime Bill was passed. A bill [Joe Biden](https://www.aclu.org/blog/smart-justice/mass-incarceration/how-1994-crime-bill-fed-mass-incarceration-crisis) helped write and has taken vast credit for in the past. This bill created more laws and tougher sentences resulting in more convictions for longer periods of time. It also led to following; the death penalty being available for 60 plus crimes, young people being tried as adults and more African Americans being given unjust sentences. In [2017](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/30/shrinking-gap-between-number-of-blacks-and-whites-in-prison/), it was recorded that African Americans make up roughly 1/3rd of the prison population yet less than a 1/6th of the American population. While there is no direct correlation to this bill and the disproportionate amount of blacks in prison it did nothing to help. Understanding the issue the [First Step Act](https://www.bop.gov/inmates/fsa/overview.jsp) was signed in December 2018 by Donald Trump to fix this problem. The bill reduces the sentencing for non-violent drug offenses and is designed to rehabilitate and reduce the chance of a repeat offender. The bill has also directly reduced current sentences and allowed prisoners to be released. The bill increases good behavior credit by 14% retroactively. Meaning 10 years of good behavior can reward up to 540 days reduced sentencing. Allowing some prisoners to be released immediately and others sooner than later. It also rewards earned time credit to inmates who participate in rehabilitative programs. Giving them an opportunity to be placed in a halfway home and helping to prevent re-incarceration. In the [first 4 months](https://thecrimereport.org/2019/06/10/first-step-act-cut-sentences-for-1051-fed-prisoners-in-four-months-report/) of this bill being passed over 1,000 inmates sentences were reduced. They were reduced by an average of 6 years with over 91% of those recipients being African American. This bill will not completely fix the wrongs in the prison system. No one bill can correct decades of injustice, but it can be the first step.",1592262194.0,23,Republican

h9tffr,"With so many cities allowing unchecked violence and looting, not to mention the take over whole swaths of a city and talk of defunding police, how can we expect anyone to ever start a business again?","If you're a young person who one day might start a business, or someone who was looking to do so now for that matter, how would you possibly dare risk your capital (and your life) when it has been made abundantly clear in cities all across the country that the state and local governments are *too afraid* to enforce the laws we fund them to enforce?  

Why would anyone in their right mind risk building *anything* after what we've seen in the last few weeks?  Not only did we just learn that some substantial proportion of our population is ready at a moment's notice to jump up literally loot and burn their own cities (we've seen it before but this is different, this is widespread, more destructive, more pervasive, longer lasting), but state and local governments are also apologizing for it and cowering away and opting instead to be derelict in their duties.  You would have to be crazy to take a chance on a business now.  For how much longer will that be the case?

What is this going to do to entrepreneurship in the long term?  What young people are learning today is that at any point everything can be demolished and no one will stop it, in fact the media will encourage it.  Where will this drive to engage in commerce be driven?  Perhaps into the black market instead?  Why do business legally when it can be taken away so flippantly, the state we pay taxes to will do nothing to save, and hey, it looks like the wild west anyways, you probably won't even get caught.  It's pretty easy to business outside of the law when there is no law.

All of this is incredibly corrosive to so much in civil society, but in particular to the healthy flora of businesses and entrepreneurship that make up a healthy, functioning society, and going forward we *absolutely must* reassert law and order or else Americans will lose their sense that they can safely and securely do business at all.

Ok, so, what is a conservative? “Traditionalist conservatives believe that human society is essentially hierarchical”, “traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle”.
Ok, now, let’s see what fascism is. “The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people”.
So, to me at least, right wing and fascism sound like opposites, does it not to you? But somehow fascism is “Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalism”. Is it just me or is this a complete contradiction? Let me know your thoughts please.

CDC can't explain this!
It is so mysterious the way it lurks in schools, but then dies at Home Depot. It can wreak havoc in churches;
praying people are exceptionally vulnerable! Although it’s Mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to
watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath. It is very sneaky.

It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl's but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic, it can't spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but It
can't survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe. It’s the most curious thing, it lives on basketballs, baseball bats and ballet bars, but dies on WWE ropes and Walmart
shopping carts. It is spread by hair stylists, dog groomers, and dentists, but not by bank tellers, cashiers, and fast food workers. 

COVID-19 is so smart. It won’t bother the first 10 people but it knows when the 11th person shows up so be careful if that’s you. It even knows what you want vs what you need. If you want a massage or your nails done it is
very actively on the prowl and not even a mask can stop it but If you need a plumber, it is weak, and a mask will keep it away. It also seems to be most dangerous after 5:30pm.",1592115310.0,35,Republican

I appreciate that not everyone generally aligned with conservative values supports gay marriage or even homosexuality as a whole. What the leftists don't like about me is that I don't ONLY see the world through the lense of identity and that I can turn the other cheek on these anti-gay sentiments in favor of the many other conservative values I am aligned with.

I really hate how left wing media’s love to make almost everything a white people with racism problem.  Is anyone else able to explain to me how protesting is only a white privileged thing?

I also believe systematic racism isn’t the problem it’s more of the problem of the people itself in how they treat each other culture.

h13fs6,BLM Donated Money is not going to Black Communities but rather to the pockets of Leftist Political Candidates!,"
1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.
2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&amp;cmte=C00401224
*⬆️ This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click “Expenditures”.
6- Scroll down until you see “Top Vendors/Recipients”.

So if for some reason you don’t understand what you’re seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Feel free to correct me if I missed something...

They feel they are one with black people all over the world, and do not even identify as American . Weird, but sure. Do you. 


Next I noticed how much they love transys. Cool too I guess. Not sure how that relates to Black lives. But sure. 

What really got me, is with a major factor in the success of a child is a 2 parent home, why do they reject the idea of the nuclear family? Thats crazy to me. Is it because they know single mothers get more food stamps, so they want to promote it? I know because we had food stamps for a time while I was growing up. More Black babies are killed every year than born in New York City. If Black lives mattered to them, why not encourage marriage so the single black women who get pregnant dont abort because "" I have to do whats best for me"".

gzrrzx,I fear for my safety as a woman if I question Democrat policies on a Whatsapp group,"I was in a Whatsapp group and I very much support the cause of BLM.I totally feel for their cause and do see there are many wrongs that the Justice System does and have witnessed personally how screwed up Justice System is in California.

My Whatsapp does not have my picture or my first and last name as I know random people can add you on whatsapp.

So in a conversation around Black Lives Matter ,people kept telling me how we should support Democrats.I said I fail to understand this as Republican party was established against Slavery.

In addition the 1994 Crime Bill the Senator Joe Biden supported disproportionately affected African Americans and I asked how if on one hand you take money from Prison Lobby and on the other hand throw a pittance at black communities what should make me think they really care for people of color.

Also, I pointed out that I see nothing much Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton or Obama have done to reform Criminal Justice System and innocents suffer and yet they keep claiming they did so much for blacks and people of color.

Some people in the group then asked me for my first and last name which was fine.I do not see any issue with that but  what happened next without any provocation and before I could reply to those messages, shocked me beyond words.

A man, an Indian male in that group looked up my information online and posted all about my age , my past phone numbers ,address and lot more personal information and started accusing me of joining that group with some different motivations.

I left that group immediately though some good people from that group reached out to me but I am feeling extremely scared that so many people now have all this personal information about me.

I have not slept well or eaten right in the last 3 days as it has left me feeling very paranoid as I am a single woman and live by myself.",1591723928.0,19,Republican

hfb9u5,Honestly...how do you see this election going?,"Thinking realistically about how we think the country is going to vote.

Ignoring what any and all media tells us, it’s hard to say if Trump’s support has gone up or down since he won.

Also, Biden is MUCH less hated than Hillary was. Hillary was HATED, and if not for the email scandal...I think she would’ve won.

But we also have to consider what is happening in the country right now. The riots, the crime, Chaz, all that stuff. Will that push moderates or center people over to the right? In my mind, no rational, sane human being will see that and go “yeah...I want more of that. I’m gonna vote for more rioting, looting and cities being burned down”.  And historically, any time there has been rioting or anarchy, there has typically been a push back from the other side when it came to the next election. But hey, maybe I’m wrong, maybe the rioting has more supporters than I think.

hdzs3e,What was the moment that solidified your support for Conservative values?,"For me it was about 2-4 yrs. ago. Trump had won the election about a month before this incident. I was taking a coding class at a Christian school at the time. I loved my teacher and still do, but she had some very liberal views despite being employed at a Baptist school in a blood red district in OH.

She talked to the class one day about future job opportunities for the STEM field. She was all about ""muh diversity"", and specifically wanted to favor women and minorities over white men in STEM job recruitment.

Her views confused me to say the least. Why should minorities get special recruiting offers in STEM or any other field? Why should I be put on the back burner over my sex and race? That doesn't seem fair at all.

That was the seed that eventually sprouted into me becoming a full-on ultraconservative.I started doing more research and found out that I was very Conservative, and agreed with the Republican party on 90% of issues. Eventually I morphed into a populist economically while keeping my ultraconservative social views. I'll be voting for Trump in 2020.

TL:DR I got redpilled by my Liberal teacher over diversity requirements in STEM fields.",1592856578.0,46,Republican
