hf2nck,The White Liberal Father of a Bi-Racial Police Officer Speaks About Black Lives Matter.,"The great thing about the Black Lives Matter movement is the degree to which the extent of racism in our society has been brought to the attention of more people.  Young people, in particular, have been energized at levels not seen since the Obama campaigns, which of course, waned in the Clinton campaign, and contributed to the rise of Donald Trump. Let’s hope it translates to the ballot box in November.

In 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. altered his focus, and emphasized income inequality, rather than white-black relations, as the most important all- encompassing issue of social justice.  He created the Poor People’s Campaign.  (I marched in its seminal event on April 26, 1968 in Washington.)  There are those that feel King was assassinated because he altered his focus to an area that was a much greater threat to the powers that be, namely, the pitfalls of American capitalism.

The Black Lives Matter website states:

*Four years ago, what is now known as the Black Lives Matter Global Network began to organize. It started out as a chapter-based, member-led organization whose mission was to build local power and to intervene when violence was inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.*

*In the years since, we’ve committed to struggling together and to imagining and creating a world free of anti-Blackness, where every Black person has the social, economic, and political power to thrive.*

Of course, the protests we’ve been witnessing have been focused on police racism, and less so, on economic racism.

The Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, is one of the few think tanks doing scientific research on police racism.  They have documented this discordance in policing between black and white communities, and have been working with police departments for many years.  Their director, Phillip A. Goff, is an inspiring individual, and his TED talk is worth checking out. 

For decades, journalists have been documenting the  racial disparities in the field of health care (to give but one example of another institution’s racism) , resulting in thousands of needless deaths. 600,000 American children have died in the last 50 years from preventable causes, with black children dying at a rate 2-3x higher than white children.  US infant mortality is the highest among Western democracies.  (And our neighbor Cuba puts us to shame in that category.) There are dozens of similar statistics.

240 million calls are made to 9-1-1 annually.  What people need to remember is that every single one of those responders is prepared to die for YOU.  Even the monster Derek Chauvin, had been willing to die for every single emergency call he responded to in his career.

How many of you are willing to die for your fellow human beings on a daily basis?

Racism is imbued in all our institutions.  The policing system surely has its problems, but if you’re counting deaths at the hands of racism, income inequality and health care disparities are much bigger problems.

As Martin Luther King, Jr. did in 1968, let’s march for the poor.",2020-06-24 15:08:12,3,1,87

hdvixd,America needs to get to the bottom of these issues for it’s survival as a Democracy.,"Just objectively.

From moment Trump came down the escalator there was suspicion of the validity of his campaign. This first big red flag was Paul Manafort and then Carter Page. Then Assagne and Wikileaks and the the enormous cloud of Russian election interference. Trump staff met hundreds of times handing data to the Russians, so much that it was obvious that there is some form of a deal going on. Then we find out about Trump Tower Moscow and large loans made possible by a Russian co-signer.

The questions remain. 

Will the Supreme Court allow oversight, or will the decision be political and partisan with the decisions made within the next week?

And we have the dealings of McConnell with Deripaska. The very guy who was in the middle of the Russian interference. 

What kind of deal was made by the GOP with the Russians?

This is bullshit and the acceptance of these dealings with a hostile foreign power should not be accepted by the American people. If we don’t have a vote then we have nothing.",2020-06-22 16:27:59,9,1,84

*  Refuse to lift even a finger to prevent mass shootings. 
* Repeatedly use our military as kindling. (see Iraq). 
* Are Currently enabling genocide in #Yemen. 
* Are completely silent about the police's extrajudicial execution of unarmed POC. (Shout out to Mitt for being the lone exception.)

* Enthusiastically support the death penalty. (Which, no surprise, is unevenly applied to POC.)

* Enabled and multiplied the national #OpioidCrisis (Research what [Marsha Blackburn
 did](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-dea-agent-opioid-crisis-fueled-by-drug-industry-and-congress/).)

* Abandoned our Kurdish allies leaving them for slaughter. 

* Are doing everything in their power to rip away healthcare for millions. (See ACA repeal attempts and current case before #SCOTUS.) 

* Total rejection of climate science that will lead to the death and suffering of millions. 

* Complete abdication of their responsibility to protect the citizens of this country by first disbanding the Pandemic Response Team and then DOING NOTHING to stop or slow the spread of the coronavirus.

hcx9vy,Help me out.,"Hi all.

I'm trying to gain a fuller understanding of political positions in the US during this very turbulent time. I'm not American but I do have a general understanding of American history as it formed part of my history degree. So for instance, I am aware of how parties have shifted stance over time, the history of chattel slavery and plantation life in the US, and I'm aware broadly of debates surrounding States Rights vs Lost Cause narratives of the civil war and commemorations of it. Further, I understand why they are significant at the moment with the removal of confederate monuments and so forth.

I was hoping if someone could fill me in on the 'democratic position' (although I know this will vary) in relation to recent events, the current political climate and race relations?

As much as possible I'm looking for answers that are sophisticated and considered, and that explain 'why' where necessary, and give sources for data, figures and quotes if used. I understand that things are very tense over there at the moment but if we could avoid rhetoric, being uncivil and mudslinging, it would be more helpful for my understanding of your position.

&gt;  
&gt;The program shields certain young immigrants from deportation and allows them to receive work permits.

**Rex Tillerson: Former Secretary of State**

Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn’t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2018

**James Mattis: Former Secretary of Defense**

…His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom “brought home the bacon”. I didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2020

**John Kelly: Former Director of Homeland Security, White House Chief of Staff**

..which he actually has a military and legal obligation to do. His incredible wife, Karen, who I have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside &amp; said strongly that “John respects you greatly. When we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.” Wrong!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2020

**Michael Flynn: Former White House National Security Adviser**

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!

Michael Wolff ... used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!

Jeff, you had your chance &amp; you blew it. Recused yourself ON DAY ONE (you never told me of a problem), and ran for the hills. You had no courage, &amp; ruined many lives. The dirty cops, &amp; others, got caught by better &amp; stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big…

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2020

**Anthony Scaramucci: Former White House Communications Director**

….got fired. Wrote a very nice book about me just recently. Now the book is a lie? Said his wife was driving him crazy, “something big” was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn’t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy

**Omarosa Manigault Newman: Former Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison**

When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2018

**Alexander Vindman: Former Director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council**

….was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, “OUT”.

I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!

I am a Canadian, although I find I have been following US Politics ever since Trump became President. 

I never really stayed up to date on US political news before this, but I find that every day is just revelation after revelation, argument after argument. 

My question is, what were the news cycles like during the Obama Administration? The Bush Administration? Before?

Has the news just ramped up their focus on the presidency, or has it always been this....intense? Did the sides switch in the Obama Administration, where FOX was trying to shine a light on the Presidents missteps with facts, and CNN/MSNBC blindly defending him? Same question with the Bush Administration?

Just wanted to know what it was like back then, and if what we are witnessing now especially and in these past four years is anything special, or (if Biden wins this year) we can just expect more books, more bombshell interviews, more secret sources speaking out etc etc.

hafopj,"""The Biden Plans:"" Episode Eight - Reopening the Economy","**Unlike the Trump admiration, Biden has a plan. And he has plan for most everything. He doesn’t just fly by the seat-of-his pants and throw things against the wall to see what sticks. Biden has a detailed and well-thought out path to take us where we want to be.**

#EPISODE EIGHT: THE BIDEN PLANS – REOPENING THE COUNTRY

#ENSURING SAFE WORK ENVIORMENTS:

•	Provide and pay for regular and reliable COVID-19 testing for every worker called back on the job

•	Ensure all workers, in all communities, have access to effective personal protective equipment

•	Ensure workers and unions have a voice in reopening plans

•	Ensure paid leave for all workers who get sick with COVID-19, for as long as they need to recover and complete quarantine

•	Guarantee federally-funded paid leave for workers caring for family members or other loved ones sick with COVID-19

•	Ensure Worker Protection and Accountability

•	Task OSHA with setting and enforcing a rigorous emergency temporary standard for worker protection

•	Ensure OSHA standard includes requirements for exposure identification and control

•	Protect workers not fully covered by OSHA

•	Pursue tough fines on corporations who do not abide by standards or recklessly expose their workers to COVID-19

•	Build a National Contact Tracing Workforce

•	Create a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps

•	Establish a COVID-19 renewable state, tribal, and local government fund

•	Extra protect for older Americans, Americans with disabilities, and high risk individuals

•	Require employers to tailor work arrangements for anyone who is in a high-risk group or has a high-risk individual in their home

#PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS:

•	Direct the federal government to create an easy-to-read Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard

•	Create voluntary “Safer for Shoppers”

•	Provide funding and technical assistance for their public health departments to certify business as compliant

•	Compliant businesses would receive a “Safer for Shoppers” sign

•	Establish testing capacity so every resident in a long-term care facility could safely see at least one visitor every week

•	Prioritize assistance for small business

•	Provide an ambitious “restart package” providing small business owners support for retaining and rehiring workers, as well as for fixed costs as long as they are bringing back workers

•	Support work-sharing so that small businesses — and larger ones, too — can bring back all of their workers

•	Provide grants for businesses to cover the costs of restarting in this challenging environment

•	Swiftly end racial inequity in small business support by ensuring  minority-owned businesses get effective access to all of these tools

REOPENING SCHOOLS &amp; CHILDCARE:



Reopening schools and childcare is perhaps the single most important step to get parents back to work. While schools stay closed, parents are struggling and students, especially low-income students and students of color, are falling behind. 

•	Scale-up National Institutes of Health-funded COVID-19 pediatric research partnerships

•	Build a Safer Schools Best Practices Clearinghouse to help schools and child care providers with approaches and tools for reopening

•	Provide funds for child care providers and schools - particularly Title I schools - to cover costs, including PPE and sanitation efforts; alterations to classrooms, schedules, class sizes, and transportation

I'm excited to be voting in the upcoming elections, I've never voted before! Here in Texas our Primary is coming up, so I had a question.

Is it worth voting for Bernie at all? Or should I just vote for Biden since he's still in the race? This isn't about who would do a better job, I'm just curious if it makes sense to try and vote for Bernie if he pulled out of the race. I'm just trying to avoid voting for Biden, but I understand he may be the person to vote for to get Trump out of office.

So, is it possible to vote for Bernie?

I know this might be a dumb question, but I'm pretty unfamiliar with the election process so I just wanted some extra information. Thanks!

I imagine something clean and clear and succinct, pointing out things that appeal to moderates or swing voters - like the economic benefits of voting for Biden (it’s bullshit that Trump gets to always claim he has the best economic policies).

gzhtxa,"After being overwhelmed the Trump's failures and corruption, I decided it would help me to keep track of them."," In no particular order:  
\-7 Trump associates found guilty, 1 awaiting trial (until DOJ dropped the case thanks to Barr), 13 Russian nationals charged, 12 Russian military intelligence officers charged in the Meuller trial. A successful Witch hunt it seems.  
\-2018, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood announces that Trump has agreed to shut down his personal charity, the Trump Foundation, after an investigation revealed what she called a “shocking pattern of illegality” involving “unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.""  
\-Trump declares a national emergency for the purpose of building a border wall. ""I didn’t need to do this,"" he tells reporters that same day, about something that is supposed to be an emergency. ""I just want to get it done faster.""  
\- He hired his daughter and son in law instead of actual qualified individuals. They are real estate heirs that now have senior West Wing positions.   
\- Trump instructed White House chief of staff John Kelly to grant son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance, despite objections from administration officials. Kushner, a senior advisor to the president, maintains close personal relationships with influential members of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Around this time, Trump does the same for Ivanka.  
\- As it turns out, Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails from a private account shared with her husband Jared Kushner to government officials. Same thing they attacked Clinton for.  
\- He used federal agents (some from prison departments, who are not trained to interact with civilians) to attack and disperse peaceful protests in Lafayette Park. He then took a picture with a bible.  
\- State Department uses Trump hotels during travel. Essentially tax money going to his hotels. Example: Vancouver B.C. $15,000 (2017).  
\- He fires people that whistleblow or try to stop his illegal activities. Attorney General was fired for pointing out that the Muslim Ban was unlawful.   
\- He told police no to be so nice and have so much restraint when arresting people.  
\- COVID-19: Lied about tests. Did nothing with the extra months. White house got really bad contracts with defunct companies his buddies owned to pay 5x prices for masks. Said we should use bleach and UV light in the body.  
\- Called countries shithole countries.  
\- Has issued pardons only to his white-collar friends. unlike other presidents that use pardons for injustice against petty criminals. (Flynn) Then he corroded the values of the DOJ by silencing professionals in the organization when they did not like that he just freed Flynn.  
\- Tried to bribe Ukraine into investigated Biden (impeached for this). then refused to allow any witnesses. In a phone call with recently-elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asks his counterpart to open an investigation into the family of former vice president Joe Biden, and into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s alleged involvement in interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This occurred days after Trump ordered staffers to freeze more than $391 million in congressionally-appropriated military aid to Ukraine.  
\- Clumsily drew over hurricane path map after wrongfully claiming on twitter that Alabama will be hit hard. He instructs National Weather Service not to contradict (correct) him.  
\- FCC repealed net neutrality, he selected Ajit Pajit I believe.  
\- Accused of rape by a 13-year-old girl. With Feinstein.   
\- Defunded parks.  
\- Ignores environmental reports to get oil lines built.  
\- Pulled out of Paris Accords.  
\- Ignorantly wants to remove USPS. Even though USPS is profitable but is only held back by old backward rules.  
\- ICE. children died there. There is not much that has to be said. Children were separated from parents and left to die in cells.  
\- Removed guidance from Obama that required public schools to allow transgender people from choosing their bathrooms.  
\- Defunded any international organization that promotes abortions.  
\- He repealed DOD policy (from Obama) so transgender people cannot openly serve.  
\- His tax bill makes corporate tax cuts permanent and individual tax cuts are only temporary.  
\- Kept open Guantanamo Bay. Kep prisoners that were supposed to be released from being released.  
\- Keep claiming immigrants are the cause of crime. They have very low crime rates.  
\- Most of his associates have been indicted for their role in the Russian intervention of our voting system. He literally is the swamp.  
\- Secretary of Environmental Protection is a formal coal lobbyist. Secretary hosted fundraising events for senators that were part of his consideration.   
\- Removed limit to use scientific research.  
\- Climate change denier.  
\- Made detaining immigrants a lucrative business for private prisons that fund his campaigns: $35 per day per inmate is the normal rate for prisons, ICE pays $300. Private prisons moved their annual conference to Trump National Doral golf resort. substandard medical care, deaths, suicides, sexual abuse, and exploitative labor practices, the Obama Justice Department had announced a phaseout of the private sector’s role in the federal prison system.  
\- He has played more golf and taken more vacations than any president recently. Yes, he made fun of Obama for golfing.  
\- Housing Urban development department. Ben Carson is not fit for the position, by his own words. Opportunity Zone program given to areas that were previously described as too rich to receive it.  
\- Said vote by mail leads to fraud. This is fake news.  
\- DOJ. Instead of being the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Barr acts like the president's defense lawyer. Barr wrote and released a deceptive ""summary"" of the Meuller report. Barr is the head of the White House's noncooperation policy with congress. Barr overruled prosecutors who sentenced Roger Stone for lying to congress.  
\- Prosecution of white-collar crimes, (price fixin', tax fraud, and environmental offenses) fallen to the lowest level in decades.  
\- Whenever corporate leaders and foreign government officials want to carry favor with trump they just stay at his DC hotel. Like how T mobile and Sprint spend 195K at the hotel while the government considered their merger deal.  
\- Munchin, head of department of finance, was supposed to divest his interest in a company due to conflict of interest...so he sold the shares to his fiance (now wife). He tried to use government jet for his honeymoon but was stopped by lawyers.  
\- Forgave taxes so companies can bring money back into the US, but those companies just used it for stock buybacks. He should have put a clause for that.   
\- Trump never disclosed his tax returns, something every president has done. He also did not put his wealth into a blind trust to prevent conflicts of interest, like other presidents have done. He is able to withdraw money at any time from the trust he made and he is provided with regular updates about the companies by his son.  
\- Current Department of Health and Human Services head was a current pharma lobbyist and president of Eli Elly (while there insulin tripled in price).  Policies that push low income families away from Medicaid. Systematic destruction of Affordable Care act by deleting links and references from government websites.  
\- Department of Transportation, wife of McConnell and owner of an international shipping business. Cut subsidies to cargo ships that compete with her family business. Gave 2.3M grant to her husband's home state local transit authority. She did not divest in a road construction company until she was ousted by Wall Street Journal.  
\- Obama created transparency by publishing daily visitor logs to the White House, Trump announced he will not do that.  
\- His executive order to investigate voter fraud was a total failure. Trump claimed 5 million fraudulent ballots, the investigation found only 4 (4 not 4 million).  
\- Tried to fire Meuller for investigating him...Subject of an investigation trying to fire the one in charge of investigating him. This fire attempt is grounds for another justice obstructing act.  
\- Don Jr accepted meeting with Russia in exchange for dirt on Clinton.  
\- Trump pardons Sheriff Arpaio, who was convicted with criminal contempt for not following order to stop racial profiling by cops.  
\- US secret service pays Trump International Gold Club 61K to rent golf carts during his trips there. Tax payer money of course.   
\- Most of the tax cuts he did were for the rich. Don't take my word for it, he said ""you all just got a lot richer"" to his guests are Mar a lago after he signed the Tax Cuts act.  
\- Trump continues to use his personal cell phone (the same guy who accused Clinton for using private servers for emails.)  
\- Paid 130K to prostitute to keep her silence about having sex with him.  
\- Trump intervenes to put a stop to the FBI’s long-planned relocation to the D.C. suburbs, pushing instead for a more costly proposal in which a new FBI headquarters would be constructed on the same plot of land—which just happens to be a short distance from a Trump Hotel. With the FBI staying put, hotel competitors can’t move in.  
\-Love for country but not for subpoenas: Barr refused to comply to subpoenas for Meuller Report AND for census question debacle. Mnuchin does not comply with the congressional subpoena for Trump tax returns. McGahn ordered not to comply with a subpoena for his testimony. Annie Donaldson does the same.  
\-Air force personnel stay at Trump hotel in Scotland. Tax payer money to Trump once again.  
\-Without warning, the administration announces its intent to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, effectively clearing the way for the Turkish military to attack American-allied Kurdish forces in the area. The president, who admitted in 2015 that the Trump Tower development in Istanbul meant he had a “little conflict of interest” when it comes to Turkey, reportedly issues the directive at the request of Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. A National Security Council staffer tells Newsweek that Trump got “rolled” during their call.  
\-The president announces plans to host the 2020 G-7 summit of world leaders at Doral, a Florida golf course that—you’ll never believe this—he owns.   
\-Forty-seven state officials, including 20 Republican governors, have made 64 visits to Trump properties, sometimes resulting in state taxpayer funds being spent there.   
\-The president has visited his properties 362 times at taxpayer expense during his administration, sometimes visiting more than one of them in a single day. In 2019 alone, he has visited his properties 81 times, helping to further establish them as centers of political power.  
\- One-hundred eleven officials from 65 foreign governments, including 57 foreign countries, have made 137 visits to a Trump property",2020-06-09 06:51:35,5,1,110

gz330a,Framing it as Bodily autonomy,"Progressives support legalizing marijuana, are pro-choice, are against police brutality, sexual violence, etc.

Why dont candidates frame their stance as an individual citizen's rights issue. Stating that they want to curtail the states power over individuals. For example, the government doesn't tell you that you can or can't drink alcohol. By extension they shouldn't tell you if you can or can't smoke a joint. Same goes for being transgender, just because you want to do something different with your body doesn't mean you give up your rights as a citizen. 

Anti-Choice advocates argue that your violating a fetuses bodily autonomy and I'd agree if it could survive outside the womb on it's own, hence why 3rd trimester abortions are banned. (Yes Inknow some believe life begins at conception, cant please everyone). Advocating for more individual freedom would highlight their hypocrisy, unless they are genuine.

Framing the arguement this way would appeal to conservatives and doesnt sacrifice any progressive ideals. Am I wrong or missing something here? Genuinely asking, not trying to troll.

However, I do not think protesting is responsible during a pandemic.

People who are protesting right now are unconsciously valuing the life of one group of people over another—black lives over the lives of the medically vulnerable. By not socially distancing, protestors are inadvertently spreading the coronavirus and causing the deaths of thousands of innocent individuals.

Although many black Americans have been murdered due to racial policing and bias, I do not think that overshadows the number of people currently dying because of an ongoing, deadly pandemic. I think we should actively call for change for the racial injustice that is so deeply rooted in this country, but during a deadly pandemic, I think we need to prioritize in minimizing the one force that is relentlessly killing thousands upon thousands of people in this country.

gx2mv3,"""The Price To Be Paid When One Dismembers The Truth"" -- A Lesson From History.","&gt;  The best way to defend oneself against the invasion of burdensome memories is to impeded their entry, to extend a *cordon sanitaire*.  It is easier to deny entry to a memory rather than to free oneself from it after it has been recorded.  [...]  The *Einsatzkommandos*, who behind the front lines in Russia machine-gunned civilians beside common graves [...] were given all the liquor they wanted so that the massacre would be blurred by drunkenness. The well-known euphemisms (""final solution,"" ""special treatment,"" the very term *Einsatzkommando*, literally, ""prompt-employment unit,"") disguised a frightful reality. [...]

&gt;  At any rate, the entire history of the brief ""millennial Reich"" can be reread as a war against memory, an Orwellian falsification of memory, falsification of reality, negation of reality.  All of Hitler's biographies, while disagreeing on the interpretation to be given to the life of this man so difficult to classify, agree on the flight from reality which marked Hitler's las years, especially beginning with the first Russian winter.  He had forbidden and denied his subjects any access to truth, contaminating their morality &amp; their memory; but, to a degree which gradually increased and attained complete paranoia in the Hitler Bunker, **Hitler barred the pass of truth to himself as well**.  [Ed. emphasis] Like all gamblers, he erected around himself a stage set woven with the superstitious lies and in which **Hitler ended by believing with the same fanatical faith that he demanded from every German.  His collapse was not only a salvation for mankind but also a demonstration **of the price to be paid when one dismembers the truth.** [Ed. emphasis]

It seems to me that this is a lesson we can draw from history that is entirely relevant to our situation in the U.S.A. 79 years later.

&amp;#x200B;

The War on Drugs is White Supremecist:

John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief: ""You want to know what \[the war on drugs\] was really about, The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying. We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""

[https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/](https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/)

&amp;#x200B;

Climate Change is real:

Jerry Taylor, (previously) senior fellow at the (libertarian) Cato Institute: ""Turns out that one of the people that I trusted the most, was in the business of consciously misrepresenting the data. And this really rattled me. Once I started looking closely at a lot of the convenient, plausible talking points I was offering, they began to fall apart in exactly that sort of fashion."" (The description of the video reads: ""Jerry Taylor, for more than two decades was a leading spokesperson against concerns expressed by the climate science community ... After doing his own 'due diligence' research, Taylor now fully endorses the climate science consensus embraced by climatologists."" TWO DECADES as an EFFECTIVE leading voice against the reality of climate change, acted for those twenty years before doing 'due diligence' research. Credits Fox News as a large part of his effective platform.)

&amp;#x200B;

Dog Whistling is an intentional republican strategy:

Lee Atwater, political consultant and strategist for the republican party (advisor to Reagan and H.W. Bush): ""You start out in 1954 by saying, 'Nigger, nigger, nigger.' By 1968 you can’t say 'nigger'—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites... 'We want to cut this,' is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than 'Nigger, nigger.'""

gwb0wa,An Idea I considered during these times.,"Obviously more cops need to be held accountable, from all sides we can say that. This is an idea I thought of as I scroll through reddit and twitter more and more.

A entity separate from the police that watches over them and a clocking in and out system. 

The system I describe would work something like this: Police clock in to start day, from the app they clock in it sends a signal that starts their body cam and keeps track of the time. Then when they clock out, the time is recorded and the body cam stops. Clocking out would be in a secure location, not on the side of the road, this way an officer cannot hide something. A computer with some simple code with compare the time the recording starts and the time the officer clocked in. All arrests and stops would be recorded into the system, along with their time. 

Now the separate accountability entity. This would be the force with the job of training, observing, and prosecuting police officers. This force would not be controlled by any police officer or sheriff but a separate party that is not in close relations with the police force unless necessary. The training part would include more rigorous, more frequent, and higher expectations for their training. This would be things along the lines of monthly to weekly tests that test an officer's ability to calmly and safely deal with a hostile or non-hostile citizen. Being able to disarm and subdue a citizen without excessive force and without getting hurt. This is still very much Work in Progress but I would like to see some feedback",2020-06-04 05:26:50,2,1,40

gw4vjb,America Was Wounded Yesterday,"    America was wounded yesterday and not from the shattered glass of shops laying in streets, not from the rubber bullets fired upon people just exercising their rights, not even from the knee that pressed into George Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. No, it was not any of these. America’s heart was crushed with a promise, a promise made by the person who was supposed to lead her. This promise was that the military would be deployed upon civilians. These are civilians that were practicing their right to peacefully assemble, a right laid down back in 1776.

    As soon as this promise was made by our faux leader we took several steps back, and I am terrified where we will end up. For if we do little more than sit on the couch and comment on how terrible it as while we eat dinner then we could end up watching a second Tulsa City Race Riots. And it will not fade away, and if do not make it clear that this is not allowed then we shall be in this situation again.

    But there is hope, and as long as we stand for the principle of freedom that this country was founded on we have that this country will be great. That is why I believe this country never stopped being great, and I refuse to listen to a person who believes that it did simply because he didn’t like the color of his predecessor’s skin. So stand before they are allowed to take your legs, speak before they are allowed to your voice, and vote before they are allowed to take your freedom!",2020-06-03 23:00:09,4,1,29
gvxz34,Why Trump is a really serious threat and you should vote him out whatever be the price.,"Yesterday, I saw the videos of Trump making nonsensical speeches holding the Bible in his hand. And when I saw it, I was petrified. I live in Turkey, and years ago, when Erdoğan had first used the Qur'an for his personal goals, everyone got really angry at him. But I said ""Everyone's exaggerating. This is not that big of a deal. Turkey is a highly secular country, and we have one of the strongest democracies outside of the Western World (guess Turkey's part in the Western World can be argued but whatever). Here I am now, sitting in a country where I can't speak without fear, where I can't love who I want to. And this is because Erdoğan is turning the country into a religious Sharia State more and more every day. Maybe even Erdoğan doesn't want that kind of authoritarianism and fascism, but he knows that he can consolidate his voters once again by claiming that ""Turkey is getting further away from ethics and religion.""

I'm not saying that the US will become a religious state per se. But what if Trump wants to make laws origined by the Bible he and his voters believe in. What if he bans same-sex marriage because ""Its not the way god intended."" Or what if he opresses religious minorities in the US. I'm not even talking about how racist he is. There is no turning back if you give him more time. You HAVE TO get rid of him. If these protests font end up in his resignation, then you should vote him out this november. I know some of you aren't fans of Joe Biden, neither am I. I'd be really happy if Bernie could become the next POTUS. But this isn't about who's worse now. This is about the survival of Democracy in the US which has acted as a beacon for centuries now. You can't give Trump any more seconds of presidency let alone 4 YEARS. For both the United States and the entire world, you have to stop this tyrant-to-be, WHATEVER the price may be.",2020-06-03 17:12:45,17,1,87

hfb9u5,Honestly...how do you see this election going?,"Thinking realistically about how we think the country is going to vote.

Ignoring what any and all media tells us, it’s hard to say if Trump’s support has gone up or down since he won.

Also, Biden is MUCH less hated than Hillary was. Hillary was HATED, and if not for the email scandal...I think she would’ve won.

But we also have to consider what is happening in the country right now. The riots, the crime, Chaz, all that stuff. Will that push moderates or center people over to the right? In my mind, no rational, sane human being will see that and go “yeah...I want more of that. I’m gonna vote for more rioting, looting and cities being burned down”.  And historically, any time there has been rioting or anarchy, there has typically been a push back from the other side when it came to the next election. But hey, maybe I’m wrong, maybe the rioting has more supporters than I think.

hdzs3e,What was the moment that solidified your support for Conservative values?,"For me it was about 2-4 yrs. ago. Trump had won the election about a month before this incident. I was taking a coding class at a Christian school at the time. I loved my teacher and still do, but she had some very liberal views despite being employed at a Baptist school in a blood red district in OH.

She talked to the class one day about future job opportunities for the STEM field. She was all about ""muh diversity"", and specifically wanted to favor women and minorities over white men in STEM job recruitment.

Her views confused me to say the least. Why should minorities get special recruiting offers in STEM or any other field? Why should I be put on the back burner over my sex and race? That doesn't seem fair at all.

That was the seed that eventually sprouted into me becoming a full-on ultraconservative.I started doing more research and found out that I was very Conservative, and agreed with the Republican party on 90% of issues. Eventually I morphed into a populist economically while keeping my ultraconservative social views. I'll be voting for Trump in 2020.

TL:DR I got redpilled by my Liberal teacher over diversity requirements in STEM fields.",2020-06-22 20:09:38,42,0,73

I’ll stop here because it only gets worse.

I understand that there probably were a lot of people who tuned in to the rally just to hate on Trump, but these numbers still speak for themselves. Maybe the silent majority is a real thing. I’d be more interested to see what the tv ratings were for the rally, but can’t seem to find any information on it at this time.

hd9lmx,"I'm a British black teenager, and not a single statue should be taken down","The reason behind why BLM chooses to take down and deface so many statues is a deep hatred for racism. It is so deep, however, that it has clouded their judgement to the point where they refuse to look back on history through a historical lens, and have instead chosen a black and white filter, separating every historical figure into people of pure evil or pure good, with nothing in between.

If only it was so easy to classify people. The truth is, nobody can be so easily judged like this, especially people who lived over 100 years ago in in a world which had very different moral beliefs from today.

Mohandas Gandhi was an open racist towards black people. Nelson Mandela was the leader of a group that bombed random innocent civilians. Mandela has a statue dedicated to him in the same place as the statue of Winston Churchill that was defaced, and yet, his statue remained untouched by BLM.

This isn't me saying that these people's statues should be removed as well. But those BLM supporters defaced the statue of a man who led the free world against the largest threat it has ever faced, based solely on the errors of his views on race. 

Why are we judging historical figures like this? Have we forgotten the fact that nobody in this world ever has been, or ever will be perfect? If we only allowed statues of perfect people, there wouldn't be a single one left standing. If BLM wants every statue of people who had errors in their character removed, they'd better remove the statues of Mandela and Gandhi as well.

When we look back on historical figures, we should balance how they are viewed based on what they did wrong AND what they did right FOR THE TIME THAT THEY LIVED IN. 

Churchill, Mandela, Washington, Gandhi, Jefferson. All these people did more right than wrong for their times, and all of the statues put up in their honor should remain there.

When I go to school and enter a history lesson, one of the key skills we learn there is how to evaluate history. Every person in this country has learned this since they were my age. And yet, here they are in the streets, going completely against these lessons. Mabye it is important to listen in class after all...",2020-06-21 16:19:40,117,0,74

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

hctb6a,Any other independents leaning right this election? What issues am I not considering?,"I’ve voted both ways, but I’m having a hard time finding common ground on the Democratic platform this election.

I voted for Obama, twice. I believe in gay marriage and equal rights. I also believe in and hope that one day we will have healthcare for all, especially with as crazy as insurance premiums are. But Medicare has its flaws and I think we need more time to make something like this work in the US. It will be a bigger overhaul than I think we ever realized.

I’m a labor and delivery nurse, so I don’t have a view on abortion. I don’t believe in it, but I don’t believe in outlawing it either after my experiences at work, so I can’t vote solely on this as an issue.
I’m not sure Coronavirus should be an issue, I think it’s something we should be working on together, but it seems it is. I think people should be allowed to choose for themselves what to do and maybe we should set up food deliveries for elderly and those confirmed to have pre-existing conditions so they don’t have to leave home.

I believe in gun rights, and am a gun owner myself. I believe in the police, and in increasing funding to attract better candidates and provide the equipment, training, and anything they need. After becoming a foster mom, we had a little girl who’s mom was brought here from Guatemala as a teenager and sold to a man. The baby we had was born of rape and mom was violently attacked. Her story and all she went through made me certain we need better protection at the border.

I don’t like everything Trump says or does, but I think a lot of that is that he’s not a career politician. I do appreciate his transparency though. We’ve never not known how he feels good or bad. 

I do like Joe Biden as a person. I think he would be a great grandfather, but I worry about how confused he gets and I feel like he would be manipulated by career politicians. I don’t think he stands well on his own.

In the primary last year, I voted for Ben Carson. I still have a lot of respect for him. I voted for not Hillary, which was also a vote for Trump, but not because I particularly liked him.

hck06h,Being a Republican in a California public college...," ... is worse than being any minority group in the same college.

I have watched so many people using the words ""Trump supporter"" to offend someone or call them a racist, a homophobe, and so on. Every time, I have to shut up, knowing damn well that I will just be canceled if I speak up. Since I work on campus, I am likely to be fired from my job as well if I make any comments that aren't far-leftist comments.

Even being silent might not be an option. One good example is the argument about cops: I believe not all of them are bad, but most students in my college believe all of them are bad ""because of the system"" or whatever. If people bring it up in conversation, I have to act like I am a left wing Democrat. If I take a neutral stance and say I don't care, I get into trouble. If I bring up my views, I am called a racist.

I work a job on campus which requires me to offer resources to different types of students, for their different needs. One popular resource I was asked to share is the video which raises bail funds for rioters. I do not endorse that. Arsonists and thieves should never have a get out of jail free card.

On the other hand, I have not been asked to share anything to students who might be related to police officers, or small business owners whose livelihoods are destroyed. They have mentioned police brutality in our diversity training, but they didn't mention black on black crime. And fun fact, black on black crime affects black people! Someone from the outside wouldn't be wrong to think that my job is more anti-police than pro-black.

I see a lot of stories on social media making fun of, and praising violence against, people who wear Trump clothing. A lot of people support the looting and rioting, spread awareness to ""vote to end racism"", want full abolition of police. This has increased following the police reform bills shared by Trump and the Senate. Part of the mob actually wanted police reform, but as soon as Trump agreed with them, they went back to the ""orange man bad"" narrative and called for abolition.

A lot of my fellow students support the Rayshard Brooks decision of felony murder, which says a lot. Other big California related news includes UCLA petitioning to fire a professor for NOT being racially biased, and the UCs voting to REPEAL the law that prohibits racial discrimination on college applications.

I do not reply to any of this because I do not want to lose my job, and I do not want to have a record that prevents future unemployment. I do not want to lose my friends, who I believe will be more open to disagreeing once everything is done. I'm not the privileged straight man the left makes me out to be. I have struggles too and I don't want to make them worse.

On that note, I'm not here for sympathy. I am here to share my thoughts and talk about some current issues with a like minded audience. I am hoping to find some fellow red students in blue states, and just have some good discussions.",2020-06-20 10:31:00,32,0,52

Imagine a Nikki Haley/Ivanka Trump ticket. Haley has proven herself to be a very strong conservative, while Ivanka has a more moderate political compass and will attract current DJT supporters. Ivanka is much less flamboyant and controversial as compared to her father as well. Add to the fact that they would potentially be the first female president and VP. They would bring in a much larger female vote than the normal republican ticket.

Overall I think that would be a very tough matchup for any democrat ticket to beat. A couple other people I think would be good candidates for president/VP are Pence and Desantis as well.

Hoping someone can provide clarity on my question. 

Back in 2016 a few of my friends publicly said that Trump would win the election (T-R-U-M-P we’re gonna trump Hillary was our slogan)
We were called every name in the book &amp; labeled as complete idiots who didn’t understand politics. But what we saw in America were a large group of voters being called names, told they were deplorable, told they didn’t understand politics &amp; were deemed sexist unless they voted for the girl. 

Fast forward to 2020 &amp; the left/Democrats are still using the same tactics of name calling &amp; criticizing that they used in the last election cycle. 

My question is: why do they think this tactic actually works? Do they simply not learn from their mistakes or are they literally too deranged that they believe this is the only logical way to act towards another group?

I, a white american, wore a MAGA hat. me, also being very conservative, had no confused friends, except the ones who thought this was a suicide mission. 

sure enough, during my second period which was chemistry, i grabbed a hall pass to use the restroom. the school principal saw me, accused me of skipping class (he never cares towards most students) he told me to go back to class, and take off my hat. he was definitely frustrated. my parents later got a call that i was skipping class, WHEN I HAD A HALL PASS. 

The friend that wore the biden hat skipped our math class on his first day. the principal didnt care.

havbid,Black Lives Matter only very recently started using ActBlue to handle it's donations. $4.35 million in donations is at risk of being directed to ActBlue instead of to helping actual black communities. LONG READ,"This is the Black Lives Matter Website: [https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)

As I am sure everyone here is aware, when you click the ""DONATE"" button on the website it takes you to ActBlue. ActBlue is a service that uses it's donations to support left-wing political campaigns.

If you access the WaybackMachine you can view the website and find when the site started using ActBlue.

At some point between June 2019 and September 2019, the site stopped using a donations service called **ThousandCurrents**, and started using **ActBlue**: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/) *^((Maybe someone else can pinpoint the date a bit better than me)**)*

(Notice also that in June 2019 the ""DONATE"" button is black and yellow, like the rest of the site. In September 2019 the button is blue and white.)

Recently there has been some controversy over the fact that sites, such as GoFundMe, have been sending Black Lives Matter donations to ""The Black Lives Matter Foundation"". The Black Lives Matter **Foundation** is **NOT** affiliated with the Black Lives Matter **Website**. [https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not)

There has also been controversy over the recent AMA done on Reddit by the Black Lives Matter founder. (Note: the person who did that AMA is **NOT** the founder of the Black Lives Matter **Foundation**)

The Black Lives Matter Foundation uses donations to fund community events that foster bettter relations between black communities and the police - A noble and good cause. The Foundation is in no way affiliated with either the aforementioned website, founder or with the current riots/protests.

**$4.35 million** is at risk here. The money has been donated through websites, such as GoFundMe, to The Black Lives Matter Foundation and risks being redirected to ActBlue.

The video was of surprising quality and clearly showed a man being attacked with a skateboard, followed by him getting tackled to the ground with threats on his life, and then him retaliating in self-defense by shooting the person who attacked him. Today, when I woke up I saw that the story had hit the news, and surprise surprise now apparently it’s all the fault of the guy who was attacked, with them claiming he was apparently part of an “armed militia”. I also took time to watch the video that was linked by the articles (NBC and CNN) and to my surprise (note sarcasm) the videos were of much lower quality, taken at a horrible angle, and edited to appear that the shooting in self defense was unwarranted. At this point, why am I even surprised. Already the city mayor is on track to remove all the statues featuring anything about exploration, colonization, etc... and is now going to send social workers to violent incidents and not police. Don’t be surprised when Albuquerque descends into further chaos and abandon, and even when they do fall into new lows, they are still going to vote Democrat because that’s what the professors and the media have taught them.",2020-06-16 16:31:39,8,0,118

What has Donald Trump done for the black community?

HBCU’s

The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act or commonly known as the “FUTURE” act was signed into law in December of 2019 by Donald Trump. The bill includes roughly $250 million dollars a year of permanent funding for HBCU’s. [HBCU’s](https://aaregistry.org/story/hbcus-in-america-a-short-history/) were founded to give former slaves higher education after the civil war. Slaves were not allowed to read, write, or learn at the level of others during slavery. Upon freedom after the Civil War they were immediately at an almost insurmountable disadvantage with the rest of American society. Without HBCU’s who knows where the African American community would be today. Without them we may never have had Martin Luther King Jr. or many other historically great African Americans. With this HBCU’s are not just building blocks of the past, but are also essential pieces to the [future](https://uncf.org/the-latest/6-reasons-hbcus-are-more-important-than-ever). More than 300,000 students attend HBCU’s yearly with 80% of them being African American. HBCU’s also graduate 20% of African Americans while making up only 3% of America’s colleges. This funding helps HBCU’s help the African American community. HBCU’s tend to have lower tuition, which allows low income minority families the opportunity to give their kids a higher education. A higher education that leads to better jobs and more economical advances for generations to come.

Tax Act

In 2017, Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. One major piece of this act was the opportunity zones and the corresponding investment in these zones. Opportunity [zones](https://eig.org/opportunityzones) are defined as an area that has a poverty rate of at least 20%. Unfortunately the poverty [rate](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) in the African American communities is currently at 22%, which is almost double the country average of 13%. The bill encourages major corporations to invest into poverty struck areas with capital gains. Capital gains are the profits made from a sale of property or an investment. Major corporations have billions of potential capital gains called unrealized gains. These unrealized gains are due to fluctuations and increases in stock prices. Every $1 increase in the stock price multiplied by shares outstanding are the unrealized gains the company has. Facebook for example has 2.49 billion shares outstanding. Meaning it has roughly 2.5 billion shares that can be traded publicly. In less than 3 months spanning from March 16, 2020 to June 8, 2020 Facebook stock has gained over $80. That is an increase of approximately $200 billion dollars in unrealized gains. To become realized gains, they would have to sell those shares and in return they would be capital gains which would be taxed. These gains are only taxed when sold and are taxed less the longer you hold them. This would encourage a company to hold onto the unrealized gains if possible. The act signed by Donald Trump gives tax breaks to these companies in return for them investing these realized gains into opportunity zones. This has exponential potential and no ceiling of [growth](https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-investors-opportunity-zones/) for these communities.

First Step Act

In 1994, the Federal Crime Bill was passed. A bill [Joe Biden](https://www.aclu.org/blog/smart-justice/mass-incarceration/how-1994-crime-bill-fed-mass-incarceration-crisis) helped write and has taken vast credit for in the past. This bill created more laws and tougher sentences resulting in more convictions for longer periods of time. It also led to following; the death penalty being available for 60 plus crimes, young people being tried as adults and more African Americans being given unjust sentences. In [2017](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/30/shrinking-gap-between-number-of-blacks-and-whites-in-prison/), it was recorded that African Americans make up roughly 1/3rd of the prison population yet less than a 1/6th of the American population. While there is no direct correlation to this bill and the disproportionate amount of blacks in prison it did nothing to help. Understanding the issue the [First Step Act](https://www.bop.gov/inmates/fsa/overview.jsp) was signed in December 2018 by Donald Trump to fix this problem. The bill reduces the sentencing for non-violent drug offenses and is designed to rehabilitate and reduce the chance of a repeat offender. The bill has also directly reduced current sentences and allowed prisoners to be released. The bill increases good behavior credit by 14% retroactively. Meaning 10 years of good behavior can reward up to 540 days reduced sentencing. Allowing some prisoners to be released immediately and others sooner than later. It also rewards earned time credit to inmates who participate in rehabilitative programs. Giving them an opportunity to be placed in a halfway home and helping to prevent re-incarceration. In the [first 4 months](https://thecrimereport.org/2019/06/10/first-step-act-cut-sentences-for-1051-fed-prisoners-in-four-months-report/) of this bill being passed over 1,000 inmates sentences were reduced. They were reduced by an average of 6 years with over 91% of those recipients being African American. This bill will not completely fix the wrongs in the prison system. No one bill can correct decades of injustice, but it can be the first step.",2020-06-15 23:03:14,23,0,46

h9tffr,"With so many cities allowing unchecked violence and looting, not to mention the take over whole swaths of a city and talk of defunding police, how can we expect anyone to ever start a business again?","If you're a young person who one day might start a business, or someone who was looking to do so now for that matter, how would you possibly dare risk your capital (and your life) when it has been made abundantly clear in cities all across the country that the state and local governments are *too afraid* to enforce the laws we fund them to enforce?  

Why would anyone in their right mind risk building *anything* after what we've seen in the last few weeks?  Not only did we just learn that some substantial proportion of our population is ready at a moment's notice to jump up literally loot and burn their own cities (we've seen it before but this is different, this is widespread, more destructive, more pervasive, longer lasting), but state and local governments are also apologizing for it and cowering away and opting instead to be derelict in their duties.  You would have to be crazy to take a chance on a business now.  For how much longer will that be the case?

What is this going to do to entrepreneurship in the long term?  What young people are learning today is that at any point everything can be demolished and no one will stop it, in fact the media will encourage it.  Where will this drive to engage in commerce be driven?  Perhaps into the black market instead?  Why do business legally when it can be taken away so flippantly, the state we pay taxes to will do nothing to save, and hey, it looks like the wild west anyways, you probably won't even get caught.  It's pretty easy to business outside of the law when there is no law.

All of this is incredibly corrosive to so much in civil society, but in particular to the healthy flora of businesses and entrepreneurship that make up a healthy, functioning society, and going forward we *absolutely must* reassert law and order or else Americans will lose their sense that they can safely and securely do business at all.

What is “right wing”? “the term right-wing originated with traditional conservatives, monarchists, and reactionaries” wikipedia says (until further notice my sources will be Wikipedia). Ok, so, what is a conservative? “Traditionalist conservatives believe that human society is essentially hierarchical”, “traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle”.
Ok, now, let’s see what fascism is. “The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people”.
So, to me at least, right wing and fascism sound like opposites, does it not to you? But somehow fascism is “Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalism”. Is it just me or is this a complete contradiction? Let me know your thoughts please.

At that convention, the party opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and selected a statewide slate of candidates.

h8oiix,Corona Virus is no joke,"

CDC can't explain this!
It is so mysterious the way it lurks in schools, but then dies at Home Depot. It can wreak havoc in churches;
praying people are exceptionally vulnerable! Although it’s Mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to
watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath. It is very sneaky.

It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl's but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic, it can't spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but It
can't survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe. It’s the most curious thing, it lives on basketballs, baseball bats and ballet bars, but dies on WWE ropes and Walmart
shopping carts. It is spread by hair stylists, dog groomers, and dentists, but not by bank tellers, cashiers, and fast food workers. 

COVID-19 is so smart. It won’t bother the first 10 people but it knows when the 11th person shows up so be careful if that’s you. It even knows what you want vs what you need. If you want a massage or your nails done it is
very actively on the prowl and not even a mask can stop it but If you need a plumber, it is weak, and a mask will keep it away. It also seems to be most dangerous after 5:30pm.",2020-06-14 06:15:10,35,0,23

I appreciate that not everyone generally aligned with conservative values supports gay marriage or even homosexuality as a whole. What the leftists don't like about me is that I don't ONLY see the world through the lense of identity and that I can turn the other cheek on these anti-gay sentiments in favor of the many other conservative values I am aligned with.

I really hate how left wing media’s love to make almost everything a white people with racism problem.  Is anyone else able to explain to me how protesting is only a white privileged thing?

I also believe systematic racism isn’t the problem it’s more of the problem of the people itself in how they treat each other culture.

1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.
2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&amp;cmte=C00401224
*⬆️ This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click “Expenditures”.
6- Scroll down until you see “Top Vendors/Recipients”.

So if for some reason you don’t understand what you’re seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Feel free to correct me if I missed something...

So I went to the BLM website to ""get woke"". I learned that BLM does not care about America. Not just the white people. They feel they are one with black people all over the world, and do not even identify as American . Weird, but sure. Do you. 


Next I noticed how much they love transys. Cool too I guess. Not sure how that relates to Black lives. But sure. 

What really got me, is with a major factor in the success of a child is a 2 parent home, why do they reject the idea of the nuclear family? Thats crazy to me. Is it because they know single mothers get more food stamps, so they want to promote it? I know because we had food stamps for a time while I was growing up. More Black babies are killed every year than born in New York City. If Black lives mattered to them, why not encourage marriage so the single black women who get pregnant dont abort because "" I have to do whats best for me"". 


If you know people who support BLM please send them to the website and have them read the about section. If they agree great, good for them. Just make sure they know what they are agreeing to.",2020-06-10 19:03:25,12,0,75

gzrrzx,I fear for my safety as a woman if I question Democrat policies on a Whatsapp group,"I was in a Whatsapp group and I very much support the cause of BLM.I totally feel for their cause and do see there are many wrongs that the Justice System does and have witnessed personally how screwed up Justice System is in California.

My Whatsapp does not have my picture or my first and last name as I know random people can add you on whatsapp.

So in a conversation around Black Lives Matter ,people kept telling me how we should support Democrats.I said I fail to understand this as Republican party was established against Slavery.

In addition the 1994 Crime Bill the Senator Joe Biden supported disproportionately affected African Americans and I asked how if on one hand you take money from Prison Lobby and on the other hand throw a pittance at black communities what should make me think they really care for people of color.

Also, I pointed out that I see nothing much Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton or Obama have done to reform Criminal Justice System and innocents suffer and yet they keep claiming they did so much for blacks and people of color.

Some people in the group then asked me for my first and last name which was fine.I do not see any issue with that but  what happened next without any provocation and before I could reply to those messages, shocked me beyond words.

A man, an Indian male in that group looked up my information online and posted all about my age , my past phone numbers ,address and lot more personal information and started accusing me of joining that group with some different motivations.

I left that group immediately though some good people from that group reached out to me but I am feeling extremely scared that so many people now have all this personal information about me.

I have not slept well or eaten right in the last 3 days as it has left me feeling very paranoid as I am a single woman and live by myself.",2020-06-09 17:32:08,19,0,83
