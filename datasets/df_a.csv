hf2nck,The White Liberal Father of a Bi-Racial Police Officer Speaks About Black Lives Matter.,"The great thing about the Black Lives Matter movement is the degree to which the extent of racism in our society has been brought to the attention of more people.  Young people, in particular, have been energized at levels not seen since the Obama campaigns, which of course, waned in the Clinton campaign, and contributed to the rise of Donald Trump. Let’s hope it translates to the ballot box in November.

In 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. altered his focus, and emphasized income inequality, rather than white-black relations, as the most important all- encompassing issue of social justice.  He created the Poor People’s Campaign.  (I marched in its seminal event on April 26, 1968 in Washington.)  There are those that feel King was assassinated because he altered his focus to an area that was a much greater threat to the powers that be, namely, the pitfalls of American capitalism.

The Black Lives Matter website states:

*Four years ago, what is now known as the Black Lives Matter Global Network began to organize. It started out as a chapter-based, member-led organization whose mission was to build local power and to intervene when violence was inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.*

*In the years since, we’ve committed to struggling together and to imagining and creating a world free of anti-Blackness, where every Black person has the social, economic, and political power to thrive.*

Of course, the protests we’ve been witnessing have been focused on police racism, and less so, on economic racism.

The Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, is one of the few think tanks doing scientific research on police racism.  They have documented this discordance in policing between black and white communities, and have been working with police departments for many years.  Their director, Phillip A. Goff, is an inspiring individual, and his TED talk is worth checking out. 

For decades, journalists have been documenting the  racial disparities in the field of health care (to give but one example of another institution’s racism) , resulting in thousands of needless deaths. 600,000 American children have died in the last 50 years from preventable causes, with black children dying at a rate 2-3x higher than white children.  US infant mortality is the highest among Western democracies.  (And our neighbor Cuba puts us to shame in that category.) There are dozens of similar statistics.

240 million calls are made to 9-1-1 annually.  What people need to remember is that every single one of those responders is prepared to die for YOU.  Even the monster Derek Chauvin, had been willing to die for every single emergency call he responded to in his career.

How many of you are willing to die for your fellow human beings on a daily basis?

Racism is imbued in all our institutions.  The policing system surely has its problems, but if you’re counting deaths at the hands of racism, income inequality and health care disparities are much bigger problems.

As Martin Luther King, Jr. did in 1968, let’s march for the poor.",1593011292.0,3,democrats

From moment Trump came down the escalator there was suspicion of the validity of his campaign. This first big red flag was Paul Manafort and then Carter Page. Then Assagne and Wikileaks and the the enormous cloud of Russian election interference. Trump staff met hundreds of times handing data to the Russians, so much that it was obvious that there is some form of a deal going on. Then we find out about Trump Tower Moscow and large loans made possible by a Russian co-signer.

The questions remain. 

Will the Supreme Court allow oversight, or will the decision be political and partisan with the decisions made within the next week?

And we have the dealings of McConnell with Deripaska. The very guy who was in the middle of the Russian interference. 

What kind of deal was made by the GOP with the Russians?

hcx9vy,Help me out.,"Hi all.

I'm trying to gain a fuller understanding of political positions in the US during this very turbulent time. I'm not American but I do have a general understanding of American history as it formed part of my history degree. So for instance, I am aware of how parties have shifted stance over time, the history of chattel slavery and plantation life in the US, and I'm aware broadly of debates surrounding States Rights vs Lost Cause narratives of the civil war and commemorations of it. Further, I understand why they are significant at the moment with the removal of confederate monuments and so forth.

I was hoping if someone could fill me in on the 'democratic position' (although I know this will vary) in relation to recent events, the current political climate and race relations?

As much as possible I'm looking for answers that are sophisticated and considered, and that explain 'why' where necessary, and give sources for data, figures and quotes if used. I understand that things are very tense over there at the moment but if we could avoid rhetoric, being uncivil and mudslinging, it would be more helpful for my understanding of your position.

&gt;  
&gt;The program shields certain young immigrants from deportation and allows them to receive work permits.

Let’s take a walk down Twitter Memory Lane and remind ourselves of the senior Trump administration officials who were apparently smart enough for Trump to hire, but once they left the administration, developed the intellectual capacity of a “rock.”

**Rex Tillerson: Former Secretary of State**

Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn’t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2018

**James Mattis: Former Secretary of Defense**

…His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom “brought home the bacon”. I didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2020

**John Kelly: Former Director of Homeland Security, White House Chief of Staff**

..which he actually has a military and legal obligation to do. His incredible wife, Karen, who I have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside &amp; said strongly that “John respects you greatly. When we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.” Wrong!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2020

**Michael Flynn: Former White House National Security Adviser**

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017

**Steve Bannon: Former White House Chief Strategist**

Michael Wolff ... used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018

**Jeff Sessions: Former Attorney General**

Jeff, you had your chance &amp; you blew it. Recused yourself ON DAY ONE (you never told me of a problem), and ran for the hills. You had no courage, &amp; ruined many lives. The dirty cops, &amp; others, got caught by better &amp; stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big…

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2020

**Anthony Scaramucci: Former White House Communications Director**

….got fired. Wrote a very nice book about me just recently. Now the book is a lie? Said his wife was driving him crazy, “something big” was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn’t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2019

**Omarosa Manigault Newman: Former Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison**

When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2018

**Alexander Vindman: Former Director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council**

….was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, “OUT”.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2020

**Don McGahn: Former White House Counsel**

I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!

I am a Canadian, although I find I have been following US Politics ever since Trump became President. 

I never really stayed up to date on US political news before this, but I find that every day is just revelation after revelation, argument after argument. 

My question is, what were the news cycles like during the Obama Administration? The Bush Administration? Before?

Has the news just ramped up their focus on the presidency, or has it always been this....intense? Did the sides switch in the Obama Administration, where FOX was trying to shine a light on the Presidents missteps with facts, and CNN/MSNBC blindly defending him? Same question with the Bush Administration?

Just wanted to know what it was like back then, and if what we are witnessing now especially and in these past four years is anything special, or (if Biden wins this year) we can just expect more books, more bombshell interviews, more secret sources speaking out etc etc.

#EPISODE EIGHT: THE BIDEN PLANS – REOPENING THE COUNTRY

#ENSURING SAFE WORK ENVIORMENTS:

•	Provide and pay for regular and reliable COVID-19 testing for every worker called back on the job

•	Ensure all workers, in all communities, have access to effective personal protective equipment

•	Ensure workers and unions have a voice in reopening plans

•	Ensure paid leave for all workers who get sick with COVID-19, for as long as they need to recover and complete quarantine

•	Guarantee federally-funded paid leave for workers caring for family members or other loved ones sick with COVID-19

•	Ensure Worker Protection and Accountability

•	Task OSHA with setting and enforcing a rigorous emergency temporary standard for worker protection

•	Ensure OSHA standard includes requirements for exposure identification and control

•	Protect workers not fully covered by OSHA

•	Pursue tough fines on corporations who do not abide by standards or recklessly expose their workers to COVID-19

•	Build a National Contact Tracing Workforce

•	Create a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps

•	Establish a COVID-19 renewable state, tribal, and local government fund

•	Extra protect for older Americans, Americans with disabilities, and high risk individuals

•	Require employers to tailor work arrangements for anyone who is in a high-risk group or has a high-risk individual in their home

#PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS:

•	Direct the federal government to create an easy-to-read Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard

•	Create voluntary “Safer for Shoppers”

•	Provide funding and technical assistance for their public health departments to certify business as compliant

•	Compliant businesses would receive a “Safer for Shoppers” sign

•	Establish testing capacity so every resident in a long-term care facility could safely see at least one visitor every week

•	Prioritize assistance for small business

•	Provide an ambitious “restart package” providing small business owners support for retaining and rehiring workers, as well as for fixed costs as long as they are bringing back workers

•	Support work-sharing so that small businesses — and larger ones, too — can bring back all of their workers

•	Provide grants for businesses to cover the costs of restarting in this challenging environment

•	Swiftly end racial inequity in small business support by ensuring  minority-owned businesses get effective access to all of these tools

REOPENING SCHOOLS &amp; CHILDCARE:



Reopening schools and childcare is perhaps the single most important step to get parents back to work. While schools stay closed, parents are struggling and students, especially low-income students and students of color, are falling behind. 

•	Scale-up National Institutes of Health-funded COVID-19 pediatric research partnerships

•	Build a Safer Schools Best Practices Clearinghouse to help schools and child care providers with approaches and tools for reopening

•	Provide funds for child care providers and schools - particularly Title I schools - to cover costs, including PPE and sanitation efforts; alterations to classrooms, schedules, class sizes, and transportation

Is it worth voting for Bernie at all? Or should I just vote for Biden since he's still in the race? This isn't about who would do a better job, I'm just curious if it makes sense to try and vote for Bernie if he pulled out of the race. I'm just trying to avoid voting for Biden, but I understand he may be the person to vote for to get Trump out of office.

So, is it possible to vote for Bernie?

Kamala Harris has a bad track record with police which carries a lot of weight considering the current situation. Does anyone think Klobuchar is the best pick?

gzhtxa,"After being overwhelmed the Trump's failures and corruption, I decided it would help me to keep track of them."," In no particular order:  
\-7 Trump associates found guilty, 1 awaiting trial (until DOJ dropped the case thanks to Barr), 13 Russian nationals charged, 12 Russian military intelligence officers charged in the Meuller trial. A successful Witch hunt it seems.  
\-2018, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood announces that Trump has agreed to shut down his personal charity, the Trump Foundation, after an investigation revealed what she called a “shocking pattern of illegality” involving “unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.""  
\-Trump declares a national emergency for the purpose of building a border wall. ""I didn’t need to do this,"" he tells reporters that same day, about something that is supposed to be an emergency. ""I just want to get it done faster.""  
\- He hired his daughter and son in law instead of actual qualified individuals. They are real estate heirs that now have senior West Wing positions.   
\- Trump instructed White House chief of staff John Kelly to grant son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance, despite objections from administration officials. Kushner, a senior advisor to the president, maintains close personal relationships with influential members of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Around this time, Trump does the same for Ivanka.  
\- As it turns out, Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails from a private account shared with her husband Jared Kushner to government officials. Same thing they attacked Clinton for.  
\- He used federal agents (some from prison departments, who are not trained to interact with civilians) to attack and disperse peaceful protests in Lafayette Park. He then took a picture with a bible.  
\- State Department uses Trump hotels during travel. Essentially tax money going to his hotels. Example: Vancouver B.C. $15,000 (2017).  
\- He fires people that whistleblow or try to stop his illegal activities. Attorney General was fired for pointing out that the Muslim Ban was unlawful.   
\- He told police no to be so nice and have so much restraint when arresting people.  
\- COVID-19: Lied about tests. Did nothing with the extra months. White house got really bad contracts with defunct companies his buddies owned to pay 5x prices for masks. Said we should use bleach and UV light in the body.  
\- Called countries shithole countries.  
\- Has issued pardons only to his white-collar friends. unlike other presidents that use pardons for injustice against petty criminals. (Flynn) Then he corroded the values of the DOJ by silencing professionals in the organization when they did not like that he just freed Flynn.  
\- Tried to bribe Ukraine into investigated Biden (impeached for this). then refused to allow any witnesses. In a phone call with recently-elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asks his counterpart to open an investigation into the family of former vice president Joe Biden, and into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s alleged involvement in interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This occurred days after Trump ordered staffers to freeze more than $391 million in congressionally-appropriated military aid to Ukraine.  
\- Clumsily drew over hurricane path map after wrongfully claiming on twitter that Alabama will be hit hard. He instructs National Weather Service not to contradict (correct) him.  
\- FCC repealed net neutrality, he selected Ajit Pajit I believe.  
\- Accused of rape by a 13-year-old girl. With Feinstein.   
\- Defunded parks.  
\- Ignores environmental reports to get oil lines built.  
\- Pulled out of Paris Accords.  
\- Ignorantly wants to remove USPS. Even though USPS is profitable but is only held back by old backward rules.  
\- ICE. children died there. There is not much that has to be said. Children were separated from parents and left to die in cells.  
\- Removed guidance from Obama that required public schools to allow transgender people from choosing their bathrooms.  
\- Defunded any international organization that promotes abortions.  
\- He repealed DOD policy (from Obama) so transgender people cannot openly serve.  
\- His tax bill makes corporate tax cuts permanent and individual tax cuts are only temporary.  
\- Kept open Guantanamo Bay. Kep prisoners that were supposed to be released from being released.  
\- Keep claiming immigrants are the cause of crime. They have very low crime rates.  
\- Most of his associates have been indicted for their role in the Russian intervention of our voting system. He literally is the swamp.  
\- Secretary of Environmental Protection is a formal coal lobbyist. Secretary hosted fundraising events for senators that were part of his consideration.   
\- Removed limit to use scientific research.  
\- Climate change denier.  
\- Made detaining immigrants a lucrative business for private prisons that fund his campaigns: $35 per day per inmate is the normal rate for prisons, ICE pays $300. Private prisons moved their annual conference to Trump National Doral golf resort. substandard medical care, deaths, suicides, sexual abuse, and exploitative labor practices, the Obama Justice Department had announced a phaseout of the private sector’s role in the federal prison system.  
\- He has played more golf and taken more vacations than any president recently. Yes, he made fun of Obama for golfing.  
\- Housing Urban development department. Ben Carson is not fit for the position, by his own words. Opportunity Zone program given to areas that were previously described as too rich to receive it.  
\- Said vote by mail leads to fraud. This is fake news.  
\- DOJ. Instead of being the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Barr acts like the president's defense lawyer. Barr wrote and released a deceptive ""summary"" of the Meuller report. Barr is the head of the White House's noncooperation policy with congress. Barr overruled prosecutors who sentenced Roger Stone for lying to congress.  
\- Prosecution of white-collar crimes, (price fixin', tax fraud, and environmental offenses) fallen to the lowest level in decades.  
\- Whenever corporate leaders and foreign government officials want to carry favor with trump they just stay at his DC hotel. Like how T mobile and Sprint spend 195K at the hotel while the government considered their merger deal.  
\- Munchin, head of department of finance, was supposed to divest his interest in a company due to conflict of interest...so he sold the shares to his fiance (now wife). He tried to use government jet for his honeymoon but was stopped by lawyers.  
\- Forgave taxes so companies can bring money back into the US, but those companies just used it for stock buybacks. He should have put a clause for that.   
\- Trump never disclosed his tax returns, something every president has done. He also did not put his wealth into a blind trust to prevent conflicts of interest, like other presidents have done. He is able to withdraw money at any time from the trust he made and he is provided with regular updates about the companies by his son.  
\- Current Department of Health and Human Services head was a current pharma lobbyist and president of Eli Elly (while there insulin tripled in price).  Policies that push low income families away from Medicaid. Systematic destruction of Affordable Care act by deleting links and references from government websites.  
\- Department of Transportation, wife of McConnell and owner of an international shipping business. Cut subsidies to cargo ships that compete with her family business. Gave 2.3M grant to her husband's home state local transit authority. She did not divest in a road construction company until she was ousted by Wall Street Journal.  
\- Obama created transparency by publishing daily visitor logs to the White House, Trump announced he will not do that.  
\- His executive order to investigate voter fraud was a total failure. Trump claimed 5 million fraudulent ballots, the investigation found only 4 (4 not 4 million).  
\- Tried to fire Meuller for investigating him...Subject of an investigation trying to fire the one in charge of investigating him. This fire attempt is grounds for another justice obstructing act.  
\- Don Jr accepted meeting with Russia in exchange for dirt on Clinton.  
\- Trump pardons Sheriff Arpaio, who was convicted with criminal contempt for not following order to stop racial profiling by cops.  
\- US secret service pays Trump International Gold Club 61K to rent golf carts during his trips there. Tax payer money of course.   
\- Most of the tax cuts he did were for the rich. Don't take my word for it, he said ""you all just got a lot richer"" to his guests are Mar a lago after he signed the Tax Cuts act.  
\- Trump continues to use his personal cell phone (the same guy who accused Clinton for using private servers for emails.)  
\- Paid 130K to prostitute to keep her silence about having sex with him.  
\- Trump intervenes to put a stop to the FBI’s long-planned relocation to the D.C. suburbs, pushing instead for a more costly proposal in which a new FBI headquarters would be constructed on the same plot of land—which just happens to be a short distance from a Trump Hotel. With the FBI staying put, hotel competitors can’t move in.  
\-Love for country but not for subpoenas: Barr refused to comply to subpoenas for Meuller Report AND for census question debacle. Mnuchin does not comply with the congressional subpoena for Trump tax returns. McGahn ordered not to comply with a subpoena for his testimony. Annie Donaldson does the same.  
\-Air force personnel stay at Trump hotel in Scotland. Tax payer money to Trump once again.  
\-Without warning, the administration announces its intent to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, effectively clearing the way for the Turkish military to attack American-allied Kurdish forces in the area. The president, who admitted in 2015 that the Trump Tower development in Istanbul meant he had a “little conflict of interest” when it comes to Turkey, reportedly issues the directive at the request of Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. A National Security Council staffer tells Newsweek that Trump got “rolled” during their call.  
\-The president announces plans to host the 2020 G-7 summit of world leaders at Doral, a Florida golf course that—you’ll never believe this—he owns.   
\-Forty-seven state officials, including 20 Republican governors, have made 64 visits to Trump properties, sometimes resulting in state taxpayer funds being spent there.   
\-The president has visited his properties 362 times at taxpayer expense during his administration, sometimes visiting more than one of them in a single day. In 2019 alone, he has visited his properties 81 times, helping to further establish them as centers of political power.  
\- One-hundred eleven officials from 65 foreign governments, including 57 foreign countries, have made 137 visits to a Trump property",1591685495.0,5,democrats

gz330a,Framing it as Bodily autonomy,"Progressives support legalizing marijuana, are pro-choice, are against police brutality, sexual violence, etc.

Why dont candidates frame their stance as an individual citizen's rights issue. Stating that they want to curtail the states power over individuals. For example, the government doesn't tell you that you can or can't drink alcohol. By extension they shouldn't tell you if you can or can't smoke a joint. Same goes for being transgender, just because you want to do something different with your body doesn't mean you give up your rights as a citizen. 

Anti-Choice advocates argue that your violating a fetuses bodily autonomy and I'd agree if it could survive outside the womb on it's own, hence why 3rd trimester abortions are banned. (Yes Inknow some believe life begins at conception, cant please everyone). Advocating for more individual freedom would highlight their hypocrisy, unless they are genuine.

Framing the arguement this way would appeal to conservatives and doesnt sacrifice any progressive ideals. Am I wrong or missing something here? Genuinely asking, not trying to troll.

People who are protesting right now are unconsciously valuing the life of one group of people over another—black lives over the lives of the medically vulnerable. By not socially distancing, protestors are inadvertently spreading the coronavirus and causing the deaths of thousands of innocent individuals.

Although many black Americans have been murdered due to racial policing and bias, I do not think that overshadows the number of people currently dying because of an ongoing, deadly pandemic. I think we should actively call for change for the racial injustice that is so deeply rooted in this country, but during a deadly pandemic, I think we need to prioritize in minimizing the one force that is relentlessly killing thousands upon thousands of people in this country.

It is easier to deny entry to a memory rather than to free oneself from it after it has been recorded.  [...]  The *Einsatzkommandos*, who behind the front lines in Russia machine-gunned civilians beside common graves [...] were given all the liquor they wanted so that the massacre would be blurred by drunkenness. The well-known euphemisms (""final solution,"" ""special treatment,"" the very term *Einsatzkommando*, literally, ""prompt-employment unit,"") disguised a frightful reality. [...]

&gt;  At any rate, the entire history of the brief ""millennial Reich"" can be reread as a war against memory, an Orwellian falsification of memory, falsification of reality, negation of reality.  All of Hitler's biographies, while disagreeing on the interpretation to be given to the life of this man so difficult to classify, agree on the flight from reality which marked Hitler's las years, especially beginning with the first Russian winter.  He had forbidden and denied his subjects any access to truth, contaminating their morality &amp; their memory; but, to a degree which gradually increased and attained complete paranoia in the Hitler Bunker, **Hitler barred the pass of truth to himself as well**.  [Ed. emphasis] Like all gamblers, he erected around himself a stage set woven with the superstitious lies and in which **Hitler ended by believing with the same fanatical faith that he demanded from every German.  His collapse was not only a salvation for mankind but also a demonstration **of the price to be paid when one dismembers the truth.** [Ed. emphasis]

""THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED"" by Primo Levi (174517)

It seems to me that this is a lesson we can draw from history that is entirely relevant to our situation in the U.S.A. 79 years later.

Purpose - To provide pro-Administration, videotape, hard news actualities to the major cities of the United States."" ""The reason: People are lazy. With television you just sit--watch--listen. The thinking(&lt;- underlined) is done for you."" The slogans ""We report, you decide"", and ""Fair and Balanced"" are lies, literally antithetical to the mission statement of the network.

&amp;#x200B;

The War on Drugs is White Supremecist:

John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief: ""You want to know what \[the war on drugs\] was really about, The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying. We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""

&amp;#x200B;

Climate Change is real:

Jerry Taylor, (previously) senior fellow at the (libertarian) Cato Institute: ""Turns out that one of the people that I trusted the most, was in the business of consciously misrepresenting the data. And this really rattled me. Once I started looking closely at a lot of the convenient, plausible talking points I was offering, they began to fall apart in exactly that sort of fashion."" (The description of the video reads: ""Jerry Taylor, for more than two decades was a leading spokesperson against concerns expressed by the climate science community ... After doing his own 'due diligence' research, Taylor now fully endorses the climate science consensus embraced by climatologists."" TWO DECADES as an EFFECTIVE leading voice against the reality of climate change, acted for those twenty years before doing 'due diligence' research. Credits Fox News as a large part of his effective platform.)

&amp;#x200B;

Dog Whistling is an intentional republican strategy:

Lee Atwater, political consultant and strategist for the republican party (advisor to Reagan and H.W. Bush): ""You start out in 1954 by saying, 'Nigger, nigger, nigger.' By 1968 you can’t say 'nigger'—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites... 'We want to cut this,' is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than 'Nigger, nigger.'""

gwb0wa,An Idea I considered during these times.,"Obviously more cops need to be held accountable, from all sides we can say that. This is an idea I thought of as I scroll through reddit and twitter more and more.

A entity separate from the police that watches over them and a clocking in and out system. 

The system I describe would work something like this: Police clock in to start day, from the app they clock in it sends a signal that starts their body cam and keeps track of the time. Then when they clock out, the time is recorded and the body cam stops. Clocking out would be in a secure location, not on the side of the road, this way an officer cannot hide something. A computer with some simple code with compare the time the recording starts and the time the officer clocked in. All arrests and stops would be recorded into the system, along with their time. 

Now the separate accountability entity. This would be the force with the job of training, observing, and prosecuting police officers. This force would not be controlled by any police officer or sheriff but a separate party that is not in close relations with the police force unless necessary. The training part would include more rigorous, more frequent, and higher expectations for their training. This would be things along the lines of monthly to weekly tests that test an officer's ability to calmly and safely deal with a hostile or non-hostile citizen. Being able to disarm and subdue a citizen without excessive force and without getting hurt. This is still very much Work in Progress but I would like to see some feedback",1591248410.0,2,democrats

gw4vjb,America Was Wounded Yesterday,"    America was wounded yesterday and not from the shattered glass of shops laying in streets, not from the rubber bullets fired upon people just exercising their rights, not even from the knee that pressed into George Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. No, it was not any of these. America’s heart was crushed with a promise, a promise made by the person who was supposed to lead her. This promise was that the military would be deployed upon civilians. These are civilians that were practicing their right to peacefully assemble, a right laid down back in 1776.

    As soon as this promise was made by our faux leader we took several steps back, and I am terrified where we will end up. For if we do little more than sit on the couch and comment on how terrible it as while we eat dinner then we could end up watching a second Tulsa City Race Riots. And it will not fade away, and if do not make it clear that this is not allowed then we shall be in this situation again.

    But there is hope, and as long as we stand for the principle of freedom that this country was founded on we have that this country will be great. That is why I believe this country never stopped being great, and I refuse to listen to a person who believes that it did simply because he didn’t like the color of his predecessor’s skin. So stand before they are allowed to take your legs, speak before they are allowed to your voice, and vote before they are allowed to take your freedom!",1591225209.0,4,democrats
gvxz34,Why Trump is a really serious threat and you should vote him out whatever be the price.,"Yesterday, I saw the videos of Trump making nonsensical speeches holding the Bible in his hand. And when I saw it, I was petrified. I live in Turkey, and years ago, when Erdoğan had first used the Qur'an for his personal goals, everyone got really angry at him. But I said ""Everyone's exaggerating. This is not that big of a deal. Turkey is a highly secular country, and we have one of the strongest democracies outside of the Western World (guess Turkey's part in the Western World can be argued but whatever). Here I am now, sitting in a country where I can't speak without fear, where I can't love who I want to. And this is because Erdoğan is turning the country into a religious Sharia State more and more every day. Maybe even Erdoğan doesn't want that kind of authoritarianism and fascism, but he knows that he can consolidate his voters once again by claiming that ""Turkey is getting further away from ethics and religion.""

I'm not saying that the US will become a religious state per se. But what if Trump wants to make laws origined by the Bible he and his voters believe in. What if he bans same-sex marriage because ""Its not the way god intended."" Or what if he opresses religious minorities in the US. I'm not even talking about how racist he is. There is no turning back if you give him more time. You HAVE TO get rid of him. If these protests font end up in his resignation, then you should vote him out this november. I know some of you aren't fans of Joe Biden, neither am I. I'd be really happy if Bernie could become the next POTUS. But this isn't about who's worse now. This is about the survival of Democracy in the US which has acted as a beacon for centuries now. You can't give Trump any more seconds of presidency let alone 4 YEARS. For both the United States and the entire world, you have to stop this tyrant-to-be, WHATEVER the price may be.",1591204365.0,17,democrats
