hafopj,"""The Biden Plans:"" Episode Eight - Reopening the Economy","**Unlike the Trump admiration, Biden has a plan. And he has plan for most everything. He doesn’t just fly by the seat-of-his pants and throw things against the wall to see what sticks. Biden has a detailed and well-thought out path to take us where we want to be.**

#EPISODE EIGHT: THE BIDEN PLANS – REOPENING THE COUNTRY

#ENSURING SAFE WORK ENVIORMENTS:

•	Provide and pay for regular and reliable COVID-19 testing for every worker called back on the job

•	Ensure all workers, in all communities, have access to effective personal protective equipment

•	Ensure workers and unions have a voice in reopening plans

•	Ensure paid leave for all workers who get sick with COVID-19, for as long as they need to recover and complete quarantine

•	Guarantee federally-funded paid leave for workers caring for family members or other loved ones sick with COVID-19

•	Ensure Worker Protection and Accountability

•	Task OSHA with setting and enforcing a rigorous emergency temporary standard for worker protection

•	Ensure OSHA standard includes requirements for exposure identification and control

•	Protect workers not fully covered by OSHA

•	Pursue tough fines on corporations who do not abide by standards or recklessly expose their workers to COVID-19

•	Build a National Contact Tracing Workforce

•	Create a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps

•	Establish a COVID-19 renewable state, tribal, and local government fund

•	Extra protect for older Americans, Americans with disabilities, and high risk individuals

•	Require employers to tailor work arrangements for anyone who is in a high-risk group or has a high-risk individual in their home

#PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS:

•	Direct the federal government to create an easy-to-read Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard

•	Create voluntary “Safer for Shoppers”

•	Provide funding and technical assistance for their public health departments to certify business as compliant

•	Compliant businesses would receive a “Safer for Shoppers” sign

•	Establish testing capacity so every resident in a long-term care facility could safely see at least one visitor every week

•	Prioritize assistance for small business

•	Provide an ambitious “restart package” providing small business owners support for retaining and rehiring workers, as well as for fixed costs as long as they are bringing back workers

•	Support work-sharing so that small businesses — and larger ones, too — can bring back all of their workers

•	Provide grants for businesses to cover the costs of restarting in this challenging environment

•	Swiftly end racial inequity in small business support by ensuring  minority-owned businesses get effective access to all of these tools

REOPENING SCHOOLS &amp; CHILDCARE:



Reopening schools and childcare is perhaps the single most important step to get parents back to work. While schools stay closed, parents are struggling and students, especially low-income students and students of color, are falling behind. 

•	Scale-up National Institutes of Health-funded COVID-19 pediatric research partnerships

•	Build a Safer Schools Best Practices Clearinghouse to help schools and child care providers with approaches and tools for reopening

•	Provide funds for child care providers and schools - particularly Title I schools - to cover costs, including PPE and sanitation efforts; alterations to classrooms, schedules, class sizes, and transportation

Let’s take a walk down Twitter Memory Lane and remind ourselves of the senior Trump administration officials who were apparently smart enough for Trump to hire, but once they left the administration, developed the intellectual capacity of a “rock.”

**Rex Tillerson: Former Secretary of State**

Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn’t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2018

**James Mattis: Former Secretary of Defense**

…His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom “brought home the bacon”. I didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2020

**John Kelly: Former Director of Homeland Security, White House Chief of Staff**

..which he actually has a military and legal obligation to do. His incredible wife, Karen, who I have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside &amp; said strongly that “John respects you greatly. When we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.” Wrong!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2020

**Michael Flynn: Former White House National Security Adviser**

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017

**Steve Bannon: Former White House Chief Strategist**

Michael Wolff ... used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018

**Jeff Sessions: Former Attorney General**

Jeff, you had your chance &amp; you blew it. Recused yourself ON DAY ONE (you never told me of a problem), and ran for the hills. You had no courage, &amp; ruined many lives. The dirty cops, &amp; others, got caught by better &amp; stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big…

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2020

**Anthony Scaramucci: Former White House Communications Director**

….got fired. Wrote a very nice book about me just recently. Now the book is a lie? Said his wife was driving him crazy, “something big” was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn’t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2019

**Omarosa Manigault Newman: Former Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison**

When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2018

**Alexander Vindman: Former Director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council**

….was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, “OUT”.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2020

**Don McGahn: Former White House Counsel**

I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!

hbicgh,What was the news cycle like in previous administrations??,"Hello all!

I am a Canadian, although I find I have been following US Politics ever since Trump became President. 

I never really stayed up to date on US political news before this, but I find that every day is just revelation after revelation, argument after argument. 

My question is, what were the news cycles like during the Obama Administration? The Bush Administration? Before?

Has the news just ramped up their focus on the presidency, or has it always been this....intense? Did the sides switch in the Obama Administration, where FOX was trying to shine a light on the Presidents missteps with facts, and CNN/MSNBC blindly defending him? Same question with the Bush Administration?

Just wanted to know what it was like back then, and if what we are witnessing now especially and in these past four years is anything special, or (if Biden wins this year) we can just expect more books, more bombshell interviews, more secret sources speaking out etc etc.

Thank you!",1592498961.0,0,democrats

I'm excited to be voting in the upcoming elections, I've never voted before! Here in Texas our Primary is coming up, so I had a question.

Is it worth voting for Bernie at all? Or should I just vote for Biden since he's still in the race? This isn't about who would do a better job, I'm just curious if it makes sense to try and vote for Bernie if he pulled out of the race. I'm just trying to avoid voting for Biden, but I understand he may be the person to vote for to get Trump out of office.

So, is it possible to vote for Bernie?

I know this might be a dumb question, but I'm pretty unfamiliar with the election process so I just wanted some extra information. Thanks!

I imagine something clean and clear and succinct, pointing out things that appeal to moderates or swing voters - like the economic benefits of voting for Biden (it’s bullshit that Trump gets to always claim he has the best economic policies). I view it as a personal plea to get people close to me to rethink their viewpoints or actually get them to the polls in the first place.

gzhtxa,"After being overwhelmed the Trump's failures and corruption, I decided it would help me to keep track of them."," In no particular order:  
\-7 Trump associates found guilty, 1 awaiting trial (until DOJ dropped the case thanks to Barr), 13 Russian nationals charged, 12 Russian military intelligence officers charged in the Meuller trial. A successful Witch hunt it seems.  
\-2018, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood announces that Trump has agreed to shut down his personal charity, the Trump Foundation, after an investigation revealed what she called a “shocking pattern of illegality” involving “unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.""  
\-Trump declares a national emergency for the purpose of building a border wall. ""I didn’t need to do this,"" he tells reporters that same day, about something that is supposed to be an emergency. ""I just want to get it done faster.""  
\- He hired his daughter and son in law instead of actual qualified individuals. They are real estate heirs that now have senior West Wing positions.   
\- Trump instructed White House chief of staff John Kelly to grant son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance, despite objections from administration officials. Kushner, a senior advisor to the president, maintains close personal relationships with influential members of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Around this time, Trump does the same for Ivanka.  
\- As it turns out, Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails from a private account shared with her husband Jared Kushner to government officials. Same thing they attacked Clinton for.  
\- He used federal agents (some from prison departments, who are not trained to interact with civilians) to attack and disperse peaceful protests in Lafayette Park. He then took a picture with a bible.  
\- State Department uses Trump hotels during travel. Essentially tax money going to his hotels. Example: Vancouver B.C. $15,000 (2017).  
\- He fires people that whistleblow or try to stop his illegal activities. Attorney General was fired for pointing out that the Muslim Ban was unlawful.   
\- He told police no to be so nice and have so much restraint when arresting people.  
\- COVID-19: Lied about tests. Did nothing with the extra months. White house got really bad contracts with defunct companies his buddies owned to pay 5x prices for masks. Said we should use bleach and UV light in the body.  
\- Called countries shithole countries.  
\- Has issued pardons only to his white-collar friends. unlike other presidents that use pardons for injustice against petty criminals. (Flynn) Then he corroded the values of the DOJ by silencing professionals in the organization when they did not like that he just freed Flynn.  
\- Tried to bribe Ukraine into investigated Biden (impeached for this). then refused to allow any witnesses. In a phone call with recently-elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asks his counterpart to open an investigation into the family of former vice president Joe Biden, and into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s alleged involvement in interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This occurred days after Trump ordered staffers to freeze more than $391 million in congressionally-appropriated military aid to Ukraine.  
\- Clumsily drew over hurricane path map after wrongfully claiming on twitter that Alabama will be hit hard. He instructs National Weather Service not to contradict (correct) him.  
\- FCC repealed net neutrality, he selected Ajit Pajit I believe.  
\- Accused of rape by a 13-year-old girl. With Feinstein.   
\- Defunded parks.  
\- Ignores environmental reports to get oil lines built.  
\- Pulled out of Paris Accords.  
\- Ignorantly wants to remove USPS. Even though USPS is profitable but is only held back by old backward rules.  
\- ICE. children died there. There is not much that has to be said. Children were separated from parents and left to die in cells.  
\- Removed guidance from Obama that required public schools to allow transgender people from choosing their bathrooms.  
\- Defunded any international organization that promotes abortions.  
\- He repealed DOD policy (from Obama) so transgender people cannot openly serve.  
\- His tax bill makes corporate tax cuts permanent and individual tax cuts are only temporary.  
\- Kept open Guantanamo Bay. Kep prisoners that were supposed to be released from being released.  
\- Keep claiming immigrants are the cause of crime. They have very low crime rates.  
\- Most of his associates have been indicted for their role in the Russian intervention of our voting system. He literally is the swamp.  
\- Secretary of Environmental Protection is a formal coal lobbyist. Secretary hosted fundraising events for senators that were part of his consideration.   
\- Removed limit to use scientific research.  
\- Climate change denier.  
\- Made detaining immigrants a lucrative business for private prisons that fund his campaigns: $35 per day per inmate is the normal rate for prisons, ICE pays $300. Private prisons moved their annual conference to Trump National Doral golf resort. substandard medical care, deaths, suicides, sexual abuse, and exploitative labor practices, the Obama Justice Department had announced a phaseout of the private sector’s role in the federal prison system.  
\- He has played more golf and taken more vacations than any president recently. Yes, he made fun of Obama for golfing.  
\- Housing Urban development department. Ben Carson is not fit for the position, by his own words. Opportunity Zone program given to areas that were previously described as too rich to receive it.  
\- Said vote by mail leads to fraud. This is fake news.  
\- DOJ. Instead of being the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Barr acts like the president's defense lawyer. Barr wrote and released a deceptive ""summary"" of the Meuller report. Barr is the head of the White House's noncooperation policy with congress. Barr overruled prosecutors who sentenced Roger Stone for lying to congress.  
\- Prosecution of white-collar crimes, (price fixin', tax fraud, and environmental offenses) fallen to the lowest level in decades.  
\- Whenever corporate leaders and foreign government officials want to carry favor with trump they just stay at his DC hotel. Like how T mobile and Sprint spend 195K at the hotel while the government considered their merger deal.  
\- Munchin, head of department of finance, was supposed to divest his interest in a company due to conflict of interest...so he sold the shares to his fiance (now wife). He tried to use government jet for his honeymoon but was stopped by lawyers.  
\- Forgave taxes so companies can bring money back into the US, but those companies just used it for stock buybacks. He should have put a clause for that.   
\- Trump never disclosed his tax returns, something every president has done. He also did not put his wealth into a blind trust to prevent conflicts of interest, like other presidents have done. He is able to withdraw money at any time from the trust he made and he is provided with regular updates about the companies by his son.  
\- Current Department of Health and Human Services head was a current pharma lobbyist and president of Eli Elly (while there insulin tripled in price).  Policies that push low income families away from Medicaid. Systematic destruction of Affordable Care act by deleting links and references from government websites.  
\- Department of Transportation, wife of McConnell and owner of an international shipping business. Cut subsidies to cargo ships that compete with her family business. Gave 2.3M grant to her husband's home state local transit authority. She did not divest in a road construction company until she was ousted by Wall Street Journal.  
\- Obama created transparency by publishing daily visitor logs to the White House, Trump announced he will not do that.  
\- His executive order to investigate voter fraud was a total failure. Trump claimed 5 million fraudulent ballots, the investigation found only 4 (4 not 4 million).  
\- Tried to fire Meuller for investigating him...Subject of an investigation trying to fire the one in charge of investigating him. This fire attempt is grounds for another justice obstructing act.  
\- Don Jr accepted meeting with Russia in exchange for dirt on Clinton.  
\- Trump pardons Sheriff Arpaio, who was convicted with criminal contempt for not following order to stop racial profiling by cops.  
\- US secret service pays Trump International Gold Club 61K to rent golf carts during his trips there. Tax payer money of course.   
\- Most of the tax cuts he did were for the rich. Don't take my word for it, he said ""you all just got a lot richer"" to his guests are Mar a lago after he signed the Tax Cuts act.  
\- Trump continues to use his personal cell phone (the same guy who accused Clinton for using private servers for emails.)  
\- Paid 130K to prostitute to keep her silence about having sex with him.  
\- Trump intervenes to put a stop to the FBI’s long-planned relocation to the D.C. suburbs, pushing instead for a more costly proposal in which a new FBI headquarters would be constructed on the same plot of land—which just happens to be a short distance from a Trump Hotel. With the FBI staying put, hotel competitors can’t move in.  
\-Love for country but not for subpoenas: Barr refused to comply to subpoenas for Meuller Report AND for census question debacle. Mnuchin does not comply with the congressional subpoena for Trump tax returns. McGahn ordered not to comply with a subpoena for his testimony. Annie Donaldson does the same.  
\-Air force personnel stay at Trump hotel in Scotland. Tax payer money to Trump once again.  
\-Without warning, the administration announces its intent to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, effectively clearing the way for the Turkish military to attack American-allied Kurdish forces in the area. The president, who admitted in 2015 that the Trump Tower development in Istanbul meant he had a “little conflict of interest” when it comes to Turkey, reportedly issues the directive at the request of Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. A National Security Council staffer tells Newsweek that Trump got “rolled” during their call.  
\-The president announces plans to host the 2020 G-7 summit of world leaders at Doral, a Florida golf course that—you’ll never believe this—he owns.   
\-Forty-seven state officials, including 20 Republican governors, have made 64 visits to Trump properties, sometimes resulting in state taxpayer funds being spent there.

Why dont candidates frame their stance as an individual citizen's rights issue. Stating that they want to curtail the states power over individuals. For example, the government doesn't tell you that you can or can't drink alcohol. By extension they shouldn't tell you if you can or can't smoke a joint. Same goes for being transgender, just because you want to do something different with your body doesn't mean you give up your rights as a citizen. 

Anti-Choice advocates argue that your violating a fetuses bodily autonomy and I'd agree if it could survive outside the womb on it's own, hence why 3rd trimester abortions are banned. (Yes Inknow some believe life begins at conception, cant please everyone). Advocating for more individual freedom would highlight their hypocrisy, unless they are genuine.

Framing the arguement this way would appeal to conservatives and doesnt sacrifice any progressive ideals. Am I wrong or missing something here? Genuinely asking, not trying to troll.

However, I do not think protesting is responsible during a pandemic.

People who are protesting right now are unconsciously valuing the life of one group of people over another—black lives over the lives of the medically vulnerable. By not socially distancing, protestors are inadvertently spreading the coronavirus and causing the deaths of thousands of innocent individuals.

Although many black Americans have been murdered due to racial policing and bias, I do not think that overshadows the number of people currently dying because of an ongoing, deadly pandemic. I think we should actively call for change for the racial injustice that is so deeply rooted in this country, but during a deadly pandemic, I think we need to prioritize in minimizing the one force that is relentlessly killing thousands upon thousands of people in this country.

I went to Granbury yesterday to visit a friend and almost every democrat political sign was defaced in some way. Some had tape over them with “the swamp” or other alt right slogans written over them. In 2018 my friend had 12 BETO signs stolen, and returned the day after the election, broken and peed on.

Granbury has a serious problem.

[...]  The *Einsatzkommandos*, who behind the front lines in Russia machine-gunned civilians beside common graves [...] were given all the liquor they wanted so that the massacre would be blurred by drunkenness. The well-known euphemisms (""final solution,"" ""special treatment,"" the very term *Einsatzkommando*, literally, ""prompt-employment unit,"") disguised a frightful reality. [...]

&gt;  At any rate, the entire history of the brief ""millennial Reich"" can be reread as a war against memory, an Orwellian falsification of memory, falsification of reality, negation of reality.  All of Hitler's biographies, while disagreeing on the interpretation to be given to the life of this man so difficult to classify, agree on the flight from reality which marked Hitler's las years, especially beginning with the first Russian winter.  He had forbidden and denied his subjects any access to truth, contaminating their morality &amp; their memory; but, to a degree which gradually increased and attained complete paranoia in the Hitler Bunker, **Hitler barred the pass of truth to himself as well**.  [Ed. emphasis] Like all gamblers, he erected around himself a stage set woven with the superstitious lies and in which **Hitler ended by believing with the same fanatical faith that he demanded from every German.  His collapse was not only a salvation for mankind but also a demonstration **of the price to be paid when one dismembers the truth.** [Ed. emphasis]

The War on Drugs is White Supremecist:

John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief: ""You want to know what \[the war on drugs\] was really about, The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying. We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""

&amp;#x200B;

Climate Change is real:

Jerry Taylor, (previously) senior fellow at the (libertarian) Cato Institute: ""Turns out that one of the people that I trusted the most, was in the business of consciously misrepresenting the data. And this really rattled me. Once I started looking closely at a lot of the convenient, plausible talking points I was offering, they began to fall apart in exactly that sort of fashion."" (The description of the video reads: ""Jerry Taylor, for more than two decades was a leading spokesperson against concerns expressed by the climate science community ... After doing his own 'due diligence' research, Taylor now fully endorses the climate science consensus embraced by climatologists."" TWO DECADES as an EFFECTIVE leading voice against the reality of climate change, acted for those twenty years before doing 'due diligence' research. Credits Fox News as a large part of his effective platform.)

Dog Whistling is an intentional republican strategy:

Lee Atwater, political consultant and strategist for the republican party (advisor to Reagan and H.W. Bush): ""You start out in 1954 by saying, 'Nigger, nigger, nigger.' By 1968 you can’t say 'nigger'—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites... 'We want to cut this,' is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than 'Nigger, nigger.'""

gwb0wa,An Idea I considered during these times.,"Obviously more cops need to be held accountable, from all sides we can say that. This is an idea I thought of as I scroll through reddit and twitter more and more.

A entity separate from the police that watches over them and a clocking in and out system. 

The system I describe would work something like this: Police clock in to start day, from the app they clock in it sends a signal that starts their body cam and keeps track of the time. Then when they clock out, the time is recorded and the body cam stops. Clocking out would be in a secure location, not on the side of the road, this way an officer cannot hide something. A computer with some simple code with compare the time the recording starts and the time the officer clocked in. All arrests and stops would be recorded into the system, along with their time. 

Now the separate accountability entity. This would be the force with the job of training, observing, and prosecuting police officers. This force would not be controlled by any police officer or sheriff but a separate party that is not in close relations with the police force unless necessary. The training part would include more rigorous, more frequent, and higher expectations for their training. This would be things along the lines of monthly to weekly tests that test an officer's ability to calmly and safely deal with a hostile or non-hostile citizen. Being able to disarm and subdue a citizen without excessive force and without getting hurt. This is still very much Work in Progress but I would like to see some feedback",1591248410.0,4,democrats

gw4vjb,America Was Wounded Yesterday,"    America was wounded yesterday and not from the shattered glass of shops laying in streets, not from the rubber bullets fired upon people just exercising their rights, not even from the knee that pressed into George Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. No, it was not any of these. America’s heart was crushed with a promise, a promise made by the person who was supposed to lead her. This promise was that the military would be deployed upon civilians. These are civilians that were practicing their right to peacefully assemble, a right laid down back in 1776.

    As soon as this promise was made by our faux leader we took several steps back, and I am terrified where we will end up. For if we do little more than sit on the couch and comment on how terrible it as while we eat dinner then we could end up watching a second Tulsa City Race Riots. And it will not fade away, and if do not make it clear that this is not allowed then we shall be in this situation again.

    But there is hope, and as long as we stand for the principle of freedom that this country was founded on we have that this country will be great. That is why I believe this country never stopped being great, and I refuse to listen to a person who believes that it did simply because he didn’t like the color of his predecessor’s skin. So stand before they are allowed to take your legs, speak before they are allowed to your voice, and vote before they are allowed to take your freedom!",1591225209.0,6,democrats
gvxz34,Why Trump is a really serious threat and you should vote him out whatever be the price.,"Yesterday, I saw the videos of Trump making nonsensical speeches holding the Bible in his hand. And when I saw it, I was petrified. I live in Turkey, and years ago, when Erdoğan had first used the Qur'an for his personal goals, everyone got really angry at him. But I said ""Everyone's exaggerating. This is not that big of a deal. Turkey is a highly secular country, and we have one of the strongest democracies outside of the Western World (guess Turkey's part in the Western World can be argued but whatever). Here I am now, sitting in a country where I can't speak without fear, where I can't love who I want to. And this is because Erdoğan is turning the country into a religious Sharia State more and more every day. Maybe even Erdoğan doesn't want that kind of authoritarianism and fascism, but he knows that he can consolidate his voters once again by claiming that ""Turkey is getting further away from ethics and religion.""

I'm not saying that the US will become a religious state per se. But what if Trump wants to make laws origined by the Bible he and his voters believe in. What if he bans same-sex marriage because ""Its not the way god intended."" Or what if he opresses religious minorities in the US. I'm not even talking about how racist he is. There is no turning back if you give him more time. You HAVE TO get rid of him. If these protests font end up in his resignation, then you should vote him out this november. I know some of you aren't fans of Joe Biden, neither am I. I'd be really happy if Bernie could become the next POTUS. But this isn't about who's worse now. This is about the survival of Democracy in the US which has acted as a beacon for centuries now. You can't give Trump any more seconds of presidency let alone 4 YEARS. For both the United States and the entire world, you have to stop this tyrant-to-be, WHATEVER the price may be.",1591204365.0,17,democrats

I started crying. I know this is anecdotal, but if this movement can make HER start to question Trump, I believe we are making real change.

gvc2uc,Last night I watched Philadelphia police openly siding with and working with a large mob of white supremacists.,"(Fox news and some other news places keep claiming these nazi fucks were ""protecting their neighborhood"" but anyone who has spent time in philly knows places like fishtown are loaded with racist white meth addicted garbage)

Philly had a 6pm curfew, these white supremacists started gathering a block down from a police station just after that. They were chanting ""All lives matter"" and started harassing people around 6:20-6:45. Around 7 the actual cops show up and start being buddy buddy with these guys taking pics, sharing jokes, the mob trying to explain ""we are out here to protect YOU"" to the cops. Then the cop JOINED them and escorted them down the street has the mob hurled slurs and insults at people trying to get home/peaceful protesters. I cannot stress enough how OK the cops were with letting these guys gather past curfew and threaten bystanders (they even attacked a reporter because they didn't like him taking pictures/videos of them). Cops never attacked them, maced them, gassed them, or even arrest them, they were chilling like old fucking friends.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't even the worst part, in other parts of philly they have assholes with guns posted on top of game stop and some shitty wing buffet WITH FUCKING RIFLES WITH SEEMINGLY WITH POLICE APPROVAL ALL PAST CURFEW.

The craziest part is like an hour before this all started cops were caught on video gassing an ENTIRE peaceful protest on the highway and brutalizing protesters.

Many of the cities dealing with police brutality and race problems have local and state governments that have been dominated by democrats for generations. How much of the problem is due to democratic officials being afraid of going after police unions because they want to keep those endorsements and campaign contributions?

Job security and stability sound like great policies, but they could also be a major factor in the problem? Do police union policies make it too hard to fire an officer who's had multiple use of force complaints against them?

I just saw a story that California DAs are seeking a ban that would prohibit elected prosecutors from taking campaign contributions from police unions, but does that go far enough? Should there be a ban on any politician taking contributions from a police union? If someone is in a position where they can affect policy, it seems like a conflict of interest for them to take donations from one of the unions their policies impact.",1591079591.0,6,democrats

gu2s5r,The differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party (2020 edition),"Often on Reddit (and real life) people say both parties are the same despite the massive ideological differences between the two parties. 

/u/flantabulous originally created (about 5 years ago) a list that highlighted [vote differences between Congressional Republicans and Democrats](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2kaubu/just_a_reminder_of_what_the_senate_was_doing_the/cljns3q/) on a variety of issues and I had [reposted it](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/) elsewhere afterwards.

With the passage of time, I have decided to create an updated list that focuses on more recent vote differences between the two parties with a focus on the 115th and 116th Congresses. 

The 115th Congress was from January 3, 2017 – January 3, 2019 and had Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate. The 116th Congress is the current Congress and will last between January 3, 2019 – January 3, 2021. This Congress has a Democratic majority in the House and a Republican majority in the Senate.

This list has more of an emphasis of actions passed by the House of the 116th Congress because of [Democratic productivity headed by Nancy Pelosi and Republican obstructionism by Mitch McConnell](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/29/20977735/how-many-bills-passed-house-democrats-trump). 

*Note: Most votes listed here won't tally up to the full 435 for the House and 100 for the Senate due to absences by individual lawmakers. Independents in the Senate have been grouped with Democrats because both independents caucus with the Democratic Party.* 

With all of that said, here is the list of tallies of major votes where Republicans and Democrats were polarized.

&gt;Nah, Trump doesn’t have any interest in or desire to persuade anyone to vote for him. His only tactic is to delegitimize the opposition in the eyes of his supporters, thus having an able and willing army to back him when and if he is defeated at the ballot box. 

Trump won't leave office after losing in a landslide, will claim voter fraud and rile up his base to commit violence before and after the election. It wouldn't surprise me if 1 million of Trump's brownshirts (like those who post on T\_D) with guns will be on the streets committing violence left and right and repeatedly clash with law enforcement and the military in a futile attempt to install Trump as a dictator.

hce0kx,"Why I, a black teenager, don't agree with black lives matter","Before people spam ""whitewashed"", I wanna make it clear that this isn't just gonna be some trash racist post

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.",1592619770.0,828,Republican

I, a white american, wore a MAGA hat. me, also being very conservative, had no confused friends, except the ones who thought this was a suicide mission. 

sure enough, during my second period which was chemistry, i grabbed a hall pass to use the restroom. the school principal saw me, accused me of skipping class (he never cares towards most students) he told me to go back to class, and take off my hat. he was definitely frustrated. my parents later got a call that i was skipping class, WHEN I HAD A HALL PASS. 

The friend that wore the biden hat skipped our math class on his first day. the principal didnt care.

havbid,Black Lives Matter only very recently started using ActBlue to handle it's donations. $4.35 million in donations is at risk of being directed to ActBlue instead of to helping actual black communities. LONG READ,"This is the Black Lives Matter Website: [https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)

As I am sure everyone here is aware, when you click the ""DONATE"" button on the website it takes you to ActBlue. ActBlue is a service that uses it's donations to support left-wing political campaigns.

If you access the WaybackMachine you can view the website and find when the site started using ActBlue.

At some point between June 2019 and September 2019, the site stopped using a donations service called **ThousandCurrents**, and started using **ActBlue**: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/) *^((Maybe someone else can pinpoint the date a bit better than me)**)*

(Notice also that in June 2019 the ""DONATE"" button is black and yellow, like the rest of the site. In September 2019 the button is blue and white.)

Recently there has been some controversy over the fact that sites, such as GoFundMe, have been sending Black Lives Matter donations to ""The Black Lives Matter Foundation"". The Black Lives Matter **Foundation** is **NOT** affiliated with the Black Lives Matter **Website**. [https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not)

There has also been controversy over the recent AMA done on Reddit by the Black Lives Matter founder. (Note: the person who did that AMA is **NOT** the founder of the Black Lives Matter **Foundation**)

The Black Lives Matter Foundation uses donations to fund community events that foster bettter relations between black communities and the police - A noble and good cause. The Foundation is in no way affiliated with either the aforementioned website, founder or with the current riots/protests.

**$4.35 million** is at risk here. The money has been donated through websites, such as GoFundMe, to The Black Lives Matter Foundation and risks being redirected to ActBlue.

Today, when I woke up I saw that the story had hit the news, and surprise surprise now apparently it’s all the fault of the guy who was attacked, with them claiming he was apparently part of an “armed militia”. I also took time to watch the video that was linked by the articles (NBC and CNN) and to my surprise (note sarcasm) the videos were of much lower quality, taken at a horrible angle, and edited to appear that the shooting in self defense was unwarranted. At this point, why am I even surprised. Already the city mayor is on track to remove all the statues featuring anything about exploration, colonization, etc... and is now going to send social workers to violent incidents and not police.

What has Donald Trump done for the black community?

HBCU’s

The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act or commonly known as the “FUTURE” act was signed into law in December of 2019 by Donald Trump. The bill includes roughly $250 million dollars a year of permanent funding for HBCU’s. [HBCU’s](https://aaregistry.org/story/hbcus-in-america-a-short-history/) were founded to give former slaves higher education after the civil war. Slaves were not allowed to read, write, or learn at the level of others during slavery. Upon freedom after the Civil War they were immediately at an almost insurmountable disadvantage with the rest of American society. Without HBCU’s who knows where the African American community would be today. Without them we may never have had Martin Luther King Jr. or many other historically great African Americans. With this HBCU’s are not just building blocks of the past, but are also essential pieces to the [future](https://uncf.org/the-latest/6-reasons-hbcus-are-more-important-than-ever). More than 300,000 students attend HBCU’s yearly with 80% of them being African American. HBCU’s also graduate 20% of African Americans while making up only 3% of America’s colleges. This funding helps HBCU’s help the African American community. HBCU’s tend to have lower tuition, which allows low income minority families the opportunity to give their kids a higher education. A higher education that leads to better jobs and more economical advances for generations to come.

Tax Act

In 2017, Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. One major piece of this act was the opportunity zones and the corresponding investment in these zones. Opportunity [zones](https://eig.org/opportunityzones) are defined as an area that has a poverty rate of at least 20%. Unfortunately the poverty [rate](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) in the African American communities is currently at 22%, which is almost double the country average of 13%. The bill encourages major corporations to invest into poverty struck areas with capital gains. Capital gains are the profits made from a sale of property or an investment. Major corporations have billions of potential capital gains called unrealized gains. These unrealized gains are due to fluctuations and increases in stock prices. Every $1 increase in the stock price multiplied by shares outstanding are the unrealized gains the company has. Facebook for example has 2.49 billion shares outstanding. Meaning it has roughly 2.5 billion shares that can be traded publicly. In less than 3 months spanning from March 16, 2020 to June 8, 2020 Facebook stock has gained over $80. That is an increase of approximately $200 billion dollars in unrealized gains. To become realized gains, they would have to sell those shares and in return they would be capital gains which would be taxed. These gains are only taxed when sold and are taxed less the longer you hold them. This would encourage a company to hold onto the unrealized gains if possible. The act signed by Donald Trump gives tax breaks to these companies in return for them investing these realized gains into opportunity zones. This has exponential potential and no ceiling of [growth](https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-investors-opportunity-zones/) for these communities.

First Step Act

In 1994, the Federal Crime Bill was passed. A bill [Joe Biden](https://www.aclu.org/blog/smart-justice/mass-incarceration/how-1994-crime-bill-fed-mass-incarceration-crisis) helped write and has taken vast credit for in the past. This bill created more laws and tougher sentences resulting in more convictions for longer periods of time. It also led to following; the death penalty being available for 60 plus crimes, young people being tried as adults and more African Americans being given unjust sentences. In [2017](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/30/shrinking-gap-between-number-of-blacks-and-whites-in-prison/), it was recorded that African Americans make up roughly 1/3rd of the prison population yet less than a 1/6th of the American population. While there is no direct correlation to this bill and the disproportionate amount of blacks in prison it did nothing to help. Understanding the issue the [First Step Act](https://www.bop.gov/inmates/fsa/overview.jsp) was signed in December 2018 by Donald Trump to fix this problem. The bill reduces the sentencing for non-violent drug offenses and is designed to rehabilitate and reduce the chance of a repeat offender. The bill has also directly reduced current sentences and allowed prisoners to be released. The bill increases good behavior credit by 14% retroactively. Meaning 10 years of good behavior can reward up to 540 days reduced sentencing. Allowing some prisoners to be released immediately and others sooner than later. It also rewards earned time credit to inmates who participate in rehabilitative programs. Giving them an opportunity to be placed in a halfway home and helping to prevent re-incarceration. In the [first 4 months](https://thecrimereport.org/2019/06/10/first-step-act-cut-sentences-for-1051-fed-prisoners-in-four-months-report/) of this bill being passed over 1,000 inmates sentences were reduced. They were reduced by an average of 6 years with over 91% of those recipients being African American. This bill will not completely fix the wrongs in the prison system. No one bill can correct decades of injustice, but it can be the first step.",1592262194.0,23,Republican

h9tffr,"With so many cities allowing unchecked violence and looting, not to mention the take over whole swaths of a city and talk of defunding police, how can we expect anyone to ever start a business again?","If you're a young person who one day might start a business, or someone who was looking to do so now for that matter, how would you possibly dare risk your capital (and your life) when it has been made abundantly clear in cities all across the country that the state and local governments are *too afraid* to enforce the laws we fund them to enforce?  

Why would anyone in their right mind risk building *anything* after what we've seen in the last few weeks?  Not only did we just learn that some substantial proportion of our population is ready at a moment's notice to jump up literally loot and burn their own cities (we've seen it before but this is different, this is widespread, more destructive, more pervasive, longer lasting), but state and local governments are also apologizing for it and cowering away and opting instead to be derelict in their duties.  You would have to be crazy to take a chance on a business now.  For how much longer will that be the case?

What is this going to do to entrepreneurship in the long term?  What young people are learning today is that at any point everything can be demolished and no one will stop it, in fact the media will encourage it.  Where will this drive to engage in commerce be driven?  Perhaps into the black market instead?  Why do business legally when it can be taken away so flippantly, the state we pay taxes to will do nothing to save, and hey, it looks like the wild west anyways, you probably won't even get caught.  It's pretty easy to business outside of the law when there is no law.

All of this is incredibly corrosive to so much in civil society, but in particular to the healthy flora of businesses and entrepreneurship that make up a healthy, functioning society, and going forward we *absolutely must* reassert law and order or else Americans will lose their sense that they can safely and securely do business at all.

What is “right wing”? “the term right-wing originated with traditional conservatives, monarchists, and reactionaries” wikipedia says (until further notice my sources will be Wikipedia). Ok, so, what is a conservative? “Traditionalist conservatives believe that human society is essentially hierarchical”, “traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle”.
Ok, now, let’s see what fascism is. “The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people”.
So, to me at least, right wing and fascism sound like opposites, does it not to you? But somehow fascism is “Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalism”. Is it just me or is this a complete contradiction? Let me know your thoughts please.

CDC can't explain this!
It is so mysterious the way it lurks in schools, but then dies at Home Depot. It can wreak havoc in churches;
praying people are exceptionally vulnerable! Although it’s Mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to
watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath. It is very sneaky.

It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl's but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic, it can't spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but It
can't survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe. It’s the most curious thing, it lives on basketballs, baseball bats and ballet bars, but dies on WWE ropes and Walmart
shopping carts. It is spread by hair stylists, dog groomers, and dentists, but not by bank tellers, cashiers, and fast food workers. 

COVID-19 is so smart. It won’t bother the first 10 people but it knows when the 11th person shows up so be careful if that’s you. It even knows what you want vs what you need. If you want a massage or your nails done it is
very actively on the prowl and not even a mask can stop it but If you need a plumber, it is weak, and a mask will keep it away. It also seems to be most dangerous after 5:30pm.",1592115310.0,33,Republican

I appreciate that not everyone generally aligned with conservative values supports gay marriage or even homosexuality as a whole. What the leftists don't like about me is that I don't ONLY see the world through the lense of identity and that I can turn the other cheek on these anti-gay sentiments in favor of the many other conservative values I am aligned with.

I really hate how left wing media’s love to make almost everything a white people with racism problem.  Is anyone else able to explain to me how protesting is only a white privileged thing?

I also believe systematic racism isn’t the problem it’s more of the problem of the people itself in how they treat each other culture.

h13fs6,BLM Donated Money is not going to Black Communities but rather to the pockets of Leftist Political Candidates!,"
1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.
2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&amp;cmte=C00401224
*⬆️ This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click “Expenditures”.
6- Scroll down until you see “Top Vendors/Recipients”.

So if for some reason you don’t understand what you’re seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Feel free to correct me if I missed something...

Next I noticed how much they love transys. Cool too I guess. Not sure how that relates to Black lives. But sure. 

What really got me, is with a major factor in the success of a child is a 2 parent home, why do they reject the idea of the nuclear family? Thats crazy to me. Is it because they know single mothers get more food stamps, so they want to promote it? I know because we had food stamps for a time while I was growing up. More Black babies are killed every year than born in New York City.

gzrrzx,I fear for my safety as a woman if I question Democrat policies on a Whatsapp group,"I was in a Whatsapp group and I very much support the cause of BLM.I totally feel for their cause and do see there are many wrongs that the Justice System does and have witnessed personally how screwed up Justice System is in California.

My Whatsapp does not have my picture or my first and last name as I know random people can add you on whatsapp.

So in a conversation around Black Lives Matter ,people kept telling me how we should support Democrats.I said I fail to understand this as Republican party was established against Slavery.

In addition the 1994 Crime Bill the Senator Joe Biden supported disproportionately affected African Americans and I asked how if on one hand you take money from Prison Lobby and on the other hand throw a pittance at black communities what should make me think they really care for people of color.

Also, I pointed out that I see nothing much Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton or Obama have done to reform Criminal Justice System and innocents suffer and yet they keep claiming they did so much for blacks and people of color.

Some people in the group then asked me for my first and last name which was fine.I do not see any issue with that but  what happened next without any provocation and before I could reply to those messages, shocked me beyond words.

A man, an Indian male in that group looked up my information online and posted all about my age , my past phone numbers ,address and lot more personal information and started accusing me of joining that group with some different motivations.

I left that group immediately though some good people from that group reached out to me but I am feeling extremely scared that so many people now have all this personal information about me.

I have not slept well or eaten right in the last 3 days as it has left me feeling very paranoid as I am a single woman and live by myself.",1591723928.0,19,Republican

I’ve considered myself more moderate over the past couple years. I was raised liberal in California. And I can’t possibly support Biden or this senseless chaos going on in the world right now. 

After trying to find facts about systemic racism and claims against Trump, I cannot follow a party based in dishonesty and potentially treating minorities like dependable pawns. Also this whole current situation makes me scared to have any Democrats leading our nation. 

It feels like I’ve finally taken the red pill and woken up on the other side and it seems like this mass collective lunacy and I’m one of the only people that can see through this facade of bullshit put out by the media. 

9 unarmed blacks were killed by cops last year. Cops are 18.5x more likely to be killed by Blacks than unarmed blacks are to be killed by cops. Hardly a systemic racist war on an oppressed race. 

And Trump isn’t perfect. He’s abrasive when he speaks but if you pay attention to most of what he actually does, it is good for the country as a whole. 

Anyway, I hope more like me are trying to find proof of what the left is claiming and finds out there are so many empty meaningless arguments or strawman arguments used to justify looting and rioting of businesses, deaths of police and even protesters themselves.",1591581977.0,15,Republican

gxb6hf,Check your subscriptions and feeds. It'll drown out most of the propaganda.,"The past week or so I've started to become extremely depressed and angry seeing all of the ridiculous things going on. Not the fact that people are protesting - it's always been a thing and it's people's right to protest. Rather seeing all the looting and destruction and people cheering it on at all levels and all through this website. I rally started to wonder if I am losing my mind or if the entire rest of the world is crazy. Add to that seeing the videos of some police acting as much as thugs as the rioters. The straw that breaks the camels back is seeing how monuments in D.C. got desecrated, and even in military subs seeing people calling police pigs and pokers, and straight up calling for NG troops to fight it out with police officers.

Now none of this stuff is a big deal honestly. What drives me nuts is the fact that any dissenting opinion is quickly shut down, ridiculed, and any argument is shut down by just writing ""racist"". You literally cannot have a conversation anymore on a website that is *meant for conversation* because no discourse is allowed anymore. Only the leftist narrative is allowed by *design* on this website. Starting with the voting system that is obviously (not even trying to hide it anymore) controlled by bots rather than 1 user 1 vote. Then deleting posts and banning users who say something against the narrative. Again, what really blew my mind was this happening on military subs - I know the politics and every other default sub does that shit. 

Its just constantly being berated by the same unopposed idea that gets more and more ridiculous every fucking day. I expect in a short itme we'll have people on this website calling for the torching of governmental building or placement of car bombs or sniping of public officials and they'll be upvoted to the top, no opposition, all dissenting posts deleted and banned. 

Then I started to wonder why I'm trying to ""save"" this website. Why am I expending so much energy trying to ""change the bad boy"" if you will when its obvious that the problem is not the userbase, this comes from the very top - from the administration and in many cases mods. A website owned by Chinese interests, whom has filled the site with Chinese agents, helped them drown out the opposing voices through the use of bots. Most of this website isn't even American at this point. Yet you have all these people posting on U.S. topics and shitting on the U.S. in the process. Just take a look at my recent posts on the USA sub this morning (which laughably is full of mostly non-Americans and almost all the things posted on there on a normal day is shitting on the U.S. one way or another). The system is rigged an no amount of arguing with people will change it.

However, as a whole Reddit is still useful to meet others who share a hobby or a interest. I originally came to this website to talk about and post about anime figures and anime. Now I also like the cooking and food subs. I enjoy learning gardening and fishing skills on here and I enjoy the discussion on the investing subs. These subs are almost all devoid of any political BS of either side of the aisle. which is refreshing. I don't have a problem with people having an opposing political view (excepting nazis and commies, fuck nazis and commies) I went through and unsubbed from all subs which have become infected with the leftism-above-all virus over hte years. When I first subbed to these communities, they were either apolitical or fair in political discussion. Now that's no longer the case there's no point in being there. I use adblockers to prevent this website from getting any money from me. Hopefully ruqqus can gain traction (seeing as voat has shifted too far to the extreme right). I use the donald win website if I want to read things regarding the 2020 campaign. It's absolutely refreshing to go down my feed and not be bombarded with bullshit left and right. I've done the same on Facebook deleting old acquaintances who aren't capable of respecting the fact that I have a different opinion from them. 

At first I worried about doing the same as the left by ""shutting out"" opposing views - that I might become too engrained in my own echo chamber where I never hear anything of the opposing side. However the fact is all mainstream forms of media and telecommunications has become synonymous with the far-left - just by existing within the U.S. and using U.S. media I am exposed to the far-left narrative whether I want to or not. I don't need to actively subscribe to and consume their media. Rather I need to make an effort to support and patronize publications and media that still write based on fact and logic rather than the manifesto. I've subscribed to the Epoch times, I've subscribed to conservative and centrist youtubers and tweeters. I'm shutting out all of the left from my life - just as they do to me and others who think as I do. The left needs to be commended for two things: 

1. their patience and persistence. They will never stop no matter how hard the going gets for them at a point in history.
2. Their enviable ability to successfully, shamelessly and aggressively organize into their own groups and shut out opinions that are dangerous to their narrative and which would destroy their movement form within. Unless the center and the right is ready to do the same, they will never win the ""battle"". If we don't patronize what's left of websites, media, authors, actors, civil servants, forums, and social media that still have common sense and honesty, they will be wiped out before you know it and there will only be one opinion, one station, one channel, one party, one website approved, allowed and available. Just look at what happened ears ago on /r/christianity. It used to be pretty good and full of mainstream Christians. Then it became about shitting on mainstream Christianity because the mods and the userbase allowed atheists and anti-Christians (Not that I have an issue with either - they just don't belong in a Christian forum just as homophobes don't belong on an LGBT forum) to have a voice and say whatever they wanted in the name of ""tolerance"" until the point where they had to make another sub and call it truechristian. When you give the far-left a voice in a group they will take your inch and then take a mile.  

The fact is most people, including liberals/leftists do not agree with the way things are going down. The fact is a significantly larger number of people from all backgrounds have, do and are beginning to agree with the centrist and conservative viewpoint - but are too afraid to be vocal about it due to fear of being killed symbolically and in extreme cases literally. The silent majority if you will. The left seems like they are in the majority and in control of everything because they hoot and holler and cry the loudest. But volume does not equal quantity. One thousand people saying one thing in a whisper is more powerful than 100 people screaming another thing at the top of their lungs.",1591385110.0,42,Republican

With that in mind, I would like to dispel with the idea that you must agree with all of the BLM narrative and become an activist, otherwise “if you are silent you are complicit / racist / etc”

Im black. 

My ethnic makeup should not give  greater credence to what I am saying as long as my statements are sound wisdom.

But in today’s world, it’s all too important. 

Know this, If you go on your merry life quietly living without ever becoming an “activist” but instead you treat you neighbor with love and respect regardless of what they look like - I won’t judge you. 

In fact, I think you’ll do more good than most people ever will from their social media soap boxes.

Dont get me wrong, proactively fighting racism is a good thing. Taking an anti-racist activist position is a good thing. Fighting evil in all its forms is honorable. 

But the forceful condemnation of the passive, quiet, or even the ignorant is tiresome.  I won’t demand that you declare some virtuous position for sake of acceptance. Doing such will only lead to a war of virtue signaling that demands more.

As a black man, as a human being, and as an American, all I ask of you is to be treated with love and respect. I do not demand the groveling penitence of self-flagellation that is being required of everyone to atone for past sins of which you have never partaken.

Remember the Golden rule and honor God.

gwy0a7,Afraid to Speak,"I can’t wait until all this protesting brings racism to an end once and for all! Definitely not transforming predispositions into long term prejudice. Definitely not further dividing our Nation into two camps. For every tweet and IG post/video you make, you’re truly helping out the cause! With every angry post you make about how stupid the right is, you must be converting them to the left! You’re certainly not making them resent you for creating an environment where they can’t speak their mind. You’re certainly not doing it because it makes you feel good about getting likes and views.

“We tried kneeling and you didn’t like that!” Obviously now it’s time to break into small businesses and steal their merchandise. Of course that’s a minority of people, but its a majority of protesters that fail to condemn it! How people point out that many shops are owned by people of color. Like that should matter? Those white people that came from generations of poverty, and eventually saved and sacrificed enough to start a small business shouldn’t receive sympathy like the Asians, Latino, and Black shops! That would be racist?

Don’t listen to the black cops! What valuable input might they have? Instead abolish the police completely! If somebody graffitis on the side of my house, then it must be for good reason. If I try to scrub it off, I should be subject to criticism. My white privilege is showing. I need to kneel now before the blacks that demand me to. Apologize for all that I’ve done, simply because I was born white. 

Oh my god! A video of a cop being panicked because this drunk man is loud, uncooperative, and defiant. Most of us have no idea what to do in response, because we are afraid. Some of us make the wrong decision, and act brutally, whether the drunk man is black, white or brown. This is not a systematic police issue. It is a human issue. But instead of looking at the statistics, we look at the most shared videos, and the most retweeted opinions, and the most liked stories, and the most sarcastic comments.

If I screamed defiantly at cops in an intimidating tone, I would absolutely not be surprised if they treated me differently. But all my life I’ve been told to treat police with respect and honesty. And I’ve never had a real issue. And maybe that’s part of the issue. That cops demand too much respect. But goddamn it do I want my law enforcement to be respected? Or do I want them to apologize if a big shirtless man, black or white, gets up in their face and refuses to comply with simple requests? 

I see color more than ever! Do you not see that the civil rights movement had a backdrop of blacks not being able to drink at the same water fountain as whites? The backdrop now is that blacks, whites, Latinos and Asians have equality. But that doesn’t make things perfect. It will be a long time until color truly isn’t considered. But goddamn. Does it not delay progress if we’re hearing how blacks should get extra special treatment? How you should be sorry, or at least conscious of your white privilege? 

America is on fire! We need a voice too! Not a white voice. Not a black voice. But a voice that is not afraid of the 20 year olds that fail to realize they are unthreading the progress of racial co-existence that has taken decades to establish.

gvuz3t,Not all Republicans are racist!!,"How I See it
I am a white male republican. I am a republican because I support the economy and our troops, not because I hate black people, we are not how we are portrayed in liberal media. And I feel as through this speech I can accurately represent the majority of Republicans and their viewpoints on the #blm movement and George Floyd. I fully support the black lives matter movement, and believe that George Floyd was brutally murdered by police brutality. There is no denying the fact that a man was murdered and their should be justice for it. I believe in the protest ands it’s power as a movement. The riots, I do not believe in. All cops are bad, I do not believe in. I stand by what Trump said, in that if one steals or vandalizes, justice will be served. This is not because it is a black lives movement, this is because of crime. I believe that if one was to destroy a local business, loot stores for personal gain, and vandalize property, there should be justice served no matter who it is. A thug, is a criminal, not a person of color. 

When I say there is another side to the protest, I do not deny the fact that police brutality, and racial discrimination is a problem. And that George Floyd was murdered. But in that there are cops who are good. There are cops who want to defend their city from crime. And that is why they are deployed to cities with riots. Because they are there to try and to prevent destruction and riots. They are not there because it is a black lives movement. But because they’re city is being, destroyed and they must defend it somehow. In my mind, race is not a factor. If one is to commit a crime, there should be people there to stop them. 

There is a lot of brutality from both sides of the riot. Emotion is a leading cause. The rioters see one of their people, either attack or be attacked, and want to step in, the cops see the same. It is a war between brothers and brothers, in that I mean, cops want to defend their brothers in arms, and the protestors want to defend those whom support their movement. Both sides fuel each other, and are equally good and bad in doing so. 

The Media. 
It’s what separates us. I try and watch both sources and read up on each side as much as one can but, they are portrayed very differently. We all see what we want to see. Either police beating people, or people beating police. The media is never equal, and probably never will be. Each case of police brutality, has a case of the opposite. Murder happens everyday. We are only going to see the ones that will make headlines. As in, police brutality, or brutality against police, or people defending themselves. We don’t see police saving people everyday on the news, we don’t see them risking their lives as they do everyday, we don’t see them defending the people and property, we don’t see them stopping crime, we don’t see them playing the roles they do in keeping the United States and their communities from chaos. We see what they are in what makes the headlines. We see the bad side. And the side that liberal media wants to portray them as. Not all cops are bad. It just may seem that way because they only show the bad cops in the news.

Disrespect. The reason, most republicans see the “opposite side” (which is just not a good way to put it) is because in our news we see disrespect. Disrespect that we cannot stand, burning the flag, destroying businesses because they are owned by whites, burning houses in white communities, vandalizing other Republicans, attacking those who are using their freedom of speech in supporting trump. That’s what we see in our news. We see racism against us in these movements. Yes, racism against people of color, is terrible. Discrimination against them is intolerable and much worse than whites face. But many republicans seem racist because that is what we see in the news. They see acts of violence, committed by people of color against whites. The media, fuels them, because it only shows them these few brutal cases. Just how liberal media only shows the few brutal cases committed by white people. There is too much murder in this world to show it equally. Again, only the brutalist of the brutal make the headlines. 

So next time you see a truck with a flowing American flag out the back, don’t automatically assume we are racist. Most of us support the movement, you only see the radicals of us in your news. We only see the radicals of you in our news. At the current time it seems like most democrats see being republican as being racist, and that needs to change. The media needs to change, we all need to change.
Thank you.

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.",1592619770.0,835,Republican

I, a white american, wore a MAGA hat. me, also being very conservative, had no confused friends, except the ones who thought this was a suicide mission. 

sure enough, during my second period which was chemistry, i grabbed a hall pass to use the restroom. the school principal saw me, accused me of skipping class (he never cares towards most students) he told me to go back to class, and take off my hat. he was definitely frustrated. my parents later got a call that i was skipping class, WHEN I HAD A HALL PASS. 

The friend that wore the biden hat skipped our math class on his first day. the principal didnt care.

havbid,Black Lives Matter only very recently started using ActBlue to handle it's donations. $4.35 million in donations is at risk of being directed to ActBlue instead of to helping actual black communities. LONG READ,"This is the Black Lives Matter Website: [https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)

As I am sure everyone here is aware, when you click the ""DONATE"" button on the website it takes you to ActBlue. ActBlue is a service that uses it's donations to support left-wing political campaigns.

If you access the WaybackMachine you can view the website and find when the site started using ActBlue.

At some point between June 2019 and September 2019, the site stopped using a donations service called **ThousandCurrents**, and started using **ActBlue**: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20190615032535/https://blacklivesmatter.com/) *^((Maybe someone else can pinpoint the date a bit better than me)**)*

(Notice also that in June 2019 the ""DONATE"" button is black and yellow, like the rest of the site. In September 2019 the button is blue and white.)

Recently there has been some controversy over the fact that sites, such as GoFundMe, have been sending Black Lives Matter donations to ""The Black Lives Matter Foundation"". The Black Lives Matter **Foundation** is **NOT** affiliated with the Black Lives Matter **Website**. [https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/502850-millions-mistakenly-raised-for-black-lives-matter-group-not)

There has also been controversy over the recent AMA done on Reddit by the Black Lives Matter founder. (Note: the person who did that AMA is **NOT** the founder of the Black Lives Matter **Foundation**)

The Black Lives Matter Foundation uses donations to fund community events that foster bettter relations between black communities and the police - A noble and good cause. The Foundation is in no way affiliated with either the aforementioned website, founder or with the current riots/protests.

**$4.35 million** is at risk here. The money has been donated through websites, such as GoFundMe, to The Black Lives Matter Foundation and risks being redirected to ActBlue.

The video was of surprising quality and clearly showed a man being attacked with a skateboard, followed by him getting tackled to the ground with threats on his life, and then him retaliating in self-defense by shooting the person who attacked him. Today, when I woke up I saw that the story had hit the news, and surprise surprise now apparently it’s all the fault of the guy who was attacked, with them claiming he was apparently part of an “armed militia”. I also took time to watch the video that was linked by the articles (NBC and CNN) and to my surprise (note sarcasm) the videos were of much lower quality, taken at a horrible angle, and edited to appear that the shooting in self defense was unwarranted. At this point, why am I even surprised. Already the city mayor is on track to remove all the statues featuring anything about exploration, colonization, etc... and is now going to send social workers to violent incidents and not police.

What has Donald Trump done for the black community?

HBCU’s

The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act or commonly known as the “FUTURE” act was signed into law in December of 2019 by Donald Trump. The bill includes roughly $250 million dollars a year of permanent funding for HBCU’s. [HBCU’s](https://aaregistry.org/story/hbcus-in-america-a-short-history/) were founded to give former slaves higher education after the civil war. Slaves were not allowed to read, write, or learn at the level of others during slavery. Upon freedom after the Civil War they were immediately at an almost insurmountable disadvantage with the rest of American society. Without HBCU’s who knows where the African American community would be today. Without them we may never have had Martin Luther King Jr. or many other historically great African Americans. With this HBCU’s are not just building blocks of the past, but are also essential pieces to the [future](https://uncf.org/the-latest/6-reasons-hbcus-are-more-important-than-ever). More than 300,000 students attend HBCU’s yearly with 80% of them being African American. HBCU’s also graduate 20% of African Americans while making up only 3% of America’s colleges. This funding helps HBCU’s help the African American community. HBCU’s tend to have lower tuition, which allows low income minority families the opportunity to give their kids a higher education. A higher education that leads to better jobs and more economical advances for generations to come.

Tax Act

In 2017, Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. One major piece of this act was the opportunity zones and the corresponding investment in these zones. Opportunity [zones](https://eig.org/opportunityzones) are defined as an area that has a poverty rate of at least 20%. Unfortunately the poverty [rate](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) in the African American communities is currently at 22%, which is almost double the country average of 13%. The bill encourages major corporations to invest into poverty struck areas with capital gains. Capital gains are the profits made from a sale of property or an investment. Major corporations have billions of potential capital gains called unrealized gains. These unrealized gains are due to fluctuations and increases in stock prices. Every $1 increase in the stock price multiplied by shares outstanding are the unrealized gains the company has. Facebook for example has 2.49 billion shares outstanding. Meaning it has roughly 2.5 billion shares that can be traded publicly. In less than 3 months spanning from March 16, 2020 to June 8, 2020 Facebook stock has gained over $80. That is an increase of approximately $200 billion dollars in unrealized gains. To become realized gains, they would have to sell those shares and in return they would be capital gains which would be taxed. These gains are only taxed when sold and are taxed less the longer you hold them. This would encourage a company to hold onto the unrealized gains if possible. The act signed by Donald Trump gives tax breaks to these companies in return for them investing these realized gains into opportunity zones. This has exponential potential and no ceiling of [growth](https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-investors-opportunity-zones/) for these communities.

First Step Act

In 1994, the Federal Crime Bill was passed. A bill [Joe Biden](https://www.aclu.org/blog/smart-justice/mass-incarceration/how-1994-crime-bill-fed-mass-incarceration-crisis) helped write and has taken vast credit for in the past. This bill created more laws and tougher sentences resulting in more convictions for longer periods of time. It also led to following; the death penalty being available for 60 plus crimes, young people being tried as adults and more African Americans being given unjust sentences. In [2017](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/30/shrinking-gap-between-number-of-blacks-and-whites-in-prison/), it was recorded that African Americans make up roughly 1/3rd of the prison population yet less than a 1/6th of the American population. While there is no direct correlation to this bill and the disproportionate amount of blacks in prison it did nothing to help. Understanding the issue the [First Step Act](https://www.bop.gov/inmates/fsa/overview.jsp) was signed in December 2018 by Donald Trump to fix this problem. The bill reduces the sentencing for non-violent drug offenses and is designed to rehabilitate and reduce the chance of a repeat offender. The bill has also directly reduced current sentences and allowed prisoners to be released. The bill increases good behavior credit by 14% retroactively. Meaning 10 years of good behavior can reward up to 540 days reduced sentencing. Allowing some prisoners to be released immediately and others sooner than later. It also rewards earned time credit to inmates who participate in rehabilitative programs. Giving them an opportunity to be placed in a halfway home and helping to prevent re-incarceration. In the [first 4 months](https://thecrimereport.org/2019/06/10/first-step-act-cut-sentences-for-1051-fed-prisoners-in-four-months-report/) of this bill being passed over 1,000 inmates sentences were reduced. They were reduced by an average of 6 years with over 91% of those recipients being African American. This bill will not completely fix the wrongs in the prison system. No one bill can correct decades of injustice, but it can be the first step.",1592262194.0,23,Republican

h9tffr,"With so many cities allowing unchecked violence and looting, not to mention the take over whole swaths of a city and talk of defunding police, how can we expect anyone to ever start a business again?","If you're a young person who one day might start a business, or someone who was looking to do so now for that matter, how would you possibly dare risk your capital (and your life) when it has been made abundantly clear in cities all across the country that the state and local governments are *too afraid* to enforce the laws we fund them to enforce?  

Why would anyone in their right mind risk building *anything* after what we've seen in the last few weeks?  Not only did we just learn that some substantial proportion of our population is ready at a moment's notice to jump up literally loot and burn their own cities (we've seen it before but this is different, this is widespread, more destructive, more pervasive, longer lasting), but state and local governments are also apologizing for it and cowering away and opting instead to be derelict in their duties.  You would have to be crazy to take a chance on a business now.  For how much longer will that be the case?

What is this going to do to entrepreneurship in the long term?  What young people are learning today is that at any point everything can be demolished and no one will stop it, in fact the media will encourage it.  Where will this drive to engage in commerce be driven?  Perhaps into the black market instead?  Why do business legally when it can be taken away so flippantly, the state we pay taxes to will do nothing to save, and hey, it looks like the wild west anyways, you probably won't even get caught.  It's pretty easy to business outside of the law when there is no law.

All of this is incredibly corrosive to so much in civil society, but in particular to the healthy flora of businesses and entrepreneurship that make up a healthy, functioning society, and going forward we *absolutely must* reassert law and order or else Americans will lose their sense that they can safely and securely do business at all.

What is “right wing”? “the term right-wing originated with traditional conservatives, monarchists, and reactionaries” wikipedia says (until further notice my sources will be Wikipedia). Ok, so, what is a conservative? “Traditionalist conservatives believe that human society is essentially hierarchical”, “traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle”.
Ok, now, let’s see what fascism is. “The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people”.
So, to me at least, right wing and fascism sound like opposites, does it not to you? But somehow fascism is “Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalism”. Is it just me or is this a complete contradiction? Let me know your thoughts please.
